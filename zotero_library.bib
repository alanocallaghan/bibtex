  abstract = {Analysis of gene sets can implicate activity in signaling pathways that is responsible for cancer initiation and progression, but is not discernible from the analysis of individual genes. Multiple methods and software packages have been developed to infer pathway activity from expression measurements for set of genes targeted by that pathway. Broadly, three major methodologies have been proposed: over-representation, enrichment, and differential variability. Both over-representation and enrichment analyses are effective techniques to infer differentially regulated pathways from gene sets with relatively consistent differentially expressed (DE) genes. Specifically, these algorithms aggregate statistics from each gene in the pathway. However, they overlook multivariate patterns related to gene interactions and variations in expression. Therefore, the analysis of differential variability of multigene expression patterns can be essential to pathway inference in cancers. The corresponding methodologies and software packages for such multivariate vari\- ability analysis of pathways are reviewed here. We also introduce a new, computationally efficient algorithm, expression variation analysis (EVA), which has been implemented along with a previously proposed algorithm, Differential Rank Conservation (DIRAC), in an open source R package, gene set regulation (GSReg). EVA inferred similar pathways as DIRAC at reduced computational costs. Moreover, EVA also inferred different dysregulated pathways than those identified by enrichment analysis.},

In this study, we analyze visual activities from 15 expert radiographers and 26 novices as they view a series of images to attempt to discover relationships between a large number of features including fixation, region and subject information. We expect that the techniques used in this study will be useful in finding common behaviors in eye tracking data for medical applications.

  abstract = {Background: Understanding the dynamics of stem cell differentiation processes at the molecular level is a central challenge in developmental biology and regenerative medicine. Although the dynamic behaviors of differentiation regulators have been partially characterized, the architecture regulating the underlying molecular systems remains unclear. Result: System-level analysis of transcriptional data was performed to characterize the dynamics of molecular networks in neural differentiation of stem cells. Expression of a network module of genes tightly co-expressed in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells fluctuated greatly among cell populations before differentiation, but became stable following neural differentiation. During the neural differentiation process, genes exhibiting both differential variance and differential correlation between undifferentiated and differentiating states were related to developmental functions such as body axis development, neuronal movement, and transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, these genes were genetically associated with neuronal differentiation, providing support for the idea they are not only differentiation markers but could also play important roles in neural differentiation. Comparisons with transcriptional data from human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells revealed that the system of genes dynamically regulated during neural differentiation is conserved between mouse and human. Conclusions: The results of this study provide a systematic analytical framework for identifying key genes involved in neural differentiation by detecting their dynamical behaviors, as well as a basis for understanding the dynamic molecular mechanisms underlying the processes of neural differentiation.},

These spontaneous expression differences underlie cell fate diversity in both differentiation and disease [2]. The mechanisms responsible for generating expression variability are poorly understood. Using singlecell transcriptomics, we show that transcript variability emerging during Dictyostelium differentiation is driven predominantly by repression rather than activation. The increased variability of repressed genes was observed over a broad range of expression levels, indicating that variability is actively imposed and not a passive statistical effect of the reduced numbers of molecules accompanying repression. These findings can be explained by a simple model of transcript production, with expression controlled by the frequency, rather than the magnitude, of transcriptional firing events. Our study reveals that the generation of differences between cells can be a direct consequence of the basic mechanisms of transcriptional regulation.},

However, methods for the unsupervised integration of the resulting heterogeneous datasets are lacking. We present Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA), a computational method for discovering the principal sources of variation in multi-omic datasets. MOFA infers a set of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical sources of variability. It disentangles axes of heterogeneity that are shared across multiple modalities and those specific to individual data modalities. The learnt factors enable a variety of downstream analyses, including identification of sample subgroups, data imputation, and the detection of outlier samples. We applied MOFA to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, RNA expression, DNA methylation and             ex-vivo             drug responses. MOFA identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress. In a second application, we used MOFA to analyse single-cell multiomics data, identifying coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell differentiation.},

Recently, a novel application was developed for the automated quantification of whole-slide images. The aim of this study was to test and validate the underlying image analysis algorithm with respect to user friendliness, accuracy, and transferability to different histologic scenarios. The algorithm splits the images into tiles of a predetermined size and identifies the tissue class of each tile. In the training procedure, the user specifies example tiles of the different tissue classes. In the subsequent analysis procedure, the algorithm classifies each tile into the previously specified classes. User friendliness was evaluated by recording training time and testing reproducibility of the training procedure of users with different background. Accuracy was determined with respect to single and batch analysis. Transferability was demonstrated by analyzing tissue of different organs (rat liver, kidney, small bowel, and spleen) and with different stainings (glutamine synthetase and hematoxylin-eosin). Users of different educational background could apply the program efficiently after a short introduction. When analyzing images with similar properties, accuracy of {$>$}90\% was reached in single images as well as in batch mode. We demonstrated that the novel application is user friendly and very accurate. With the ``training'' procedure the application can be adapted to novel image characteristics simply by giving examples of relevant tissue structures. Therefore, it is suitable for the fast and efficient analysis of high numbers of fully digitalized histologic sections, potentially allowing ``high-throughput'' quantitative ``histomic'' analysis.},

  abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are often deemed too computationally intensive to be of any practical use for big data applications, and in particular for inference on datasets containing a large number n of individual data points, also known as tall datasets. In scenarios where data are assumed independent, various approaches to scale up the MetropolisHastings algorithm in a Bayesian inference context have been recently proposed in machine learning and computational statistics. These approaches can be grouped into two categories: divide-and-conquer approaches and, subsampling-based algorithms. The aims of this article are as follows. First, we present a comprehensive review of the existing literature, commenting on the underlying assumptions and theoretical guarantees of each method. Second, by leveraging our understanding of these limitations, we propose an original subsampling-based approach relying on a control variate method which samples under regularity conditions from a distribution provably close to the posterior distribution of interest, yet can require less than O(n) data point likelihood evaluations at each iteration for certain statistical models in favourable scenarios. Finally, we emphasize that we have only been able so far to propose subsampling-based methods which display good performance in scenarios where the Bernstein-von Mises approximation of the target posterior distribution is excellent. It remains an open challenge to develop such methods in scenarios where the Bernstein-von Mises approximation is poor.},

  abstract = {Learning the meaningful use of the microscope is an essential requirement in school curricula. Modern science and medicine is hardly conceivable without the inclusion of microscopy. The number of didactic studies in this area, however, is negligible. Real microscopy is rarely used to gain knowledge in higher school years. Could the understanding of cell concept and the skills to interpret histological structures be complemented and supported by digital microscopy? The current study investigates this problem in two methodological ways. First, learning effects of modules with interactive whiteboards (IWB) are compared with original microscopy (2012: n=70; 2013: 25+14; 2013/14: n=21+27; 2014: n=40) using the example of human biology with pre-service student teachers. The instruments were questionnaires (short scale of intrinsic motivation, flow, and knowledge test) and interviews. Second, eye movements of 12th grade students were measured during histological image processing of retina and nervous tissue in the student laboratory of neuroscience in Tubingen (High Quality Tower mounted eye tracking) (2013: n=11+26; 2014: n=28). We measured that fixation in the area of interest (AoI) corresponded with the level of prior knowledge. The estimation of instructional aids (e.g. schematic representation) while viewing demanding histological images also depends on prior knowledge. The same applies to the IWB. The use of the whiteboard is valued because of the possibility to make visible connections and put these in contexts. The use of the whiteboard does not, however, surpass the motivation and flow of real microscopy in problem-oriented learning processes. The IWB is a good supplement but is not a substitute for the microscope.},

We rationally introduce mutations within the TATA region of an engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL1 promoter and measure promoter responses that can be characterized as being either highly variable and rapid or steady and slow. We computationally illustrate how a stable transcription scaffold can result in ``bursts'' of gene expression, enabling rapid individual cell responses in the transient and increased cell-cell variability at steady state. We experimentally verify computational predictions that the rapid response and increased cell-cell variability enabled by TATA-containing promoters confer a clear benefit in the face of an acute environmental stress.},

In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a `DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

Here, we combine low-level features such as orientation, color, intensity, saliency maps of previous best bottom-up models with top-down cognitive visual features (e.g., faces, humans, cars, etc.) and learn a direct mapping from those features to eye fixations using Regression, SVM, and AdaBoost classifiers. By extensive experimenting over three benchmark eye-tracking datasets using three popular evaluation scores, we show that our boosting model outperforms 27 state-of-the-art models and is so far the closest model to the accuracy of human model for fixation prediction. Furthermore, our model successfully detects the most salient object in a scene without sophisticated image processings such as region segmentation.},

To address these challenges we developed scID (Single Cell IDentification), which uses the framework of Fisher's Linear Discriminant Analysis to identify transcriptionally related cell types between scRNA-seq datasets. We demonstrate the accuracy and performance of scID relative to existing methods on several published datasets. By increasing power to identify transcriptionally similar cell types across datasets, scID enhances investigator's ability to extract biological insights from scRNA-seq data.},

  abstract = {Context: Digital pathology has the potential to dramatically alter the way pathologists work, yet little is known about pathologists' viewing behavior while interpreting digital whole slide images. While tracking pathologist eye movements when viewing digital slides may be the most direct method of capturing pathologists' viewing strategies, this technique is cumbersome and technically challenging to use in remote settings. Tracking pathologist mouse cursor movements may serve as a practical method of studying digital slide interpretation, and mouse cursor data may illuminate pathologists' viewing strategies and time expenditures in their interpretive workflow. Aims: To evaluate the utility of mouse cursor movement data, in addition to eye-tracking data, in studying pathologists' attention and viewing behavior. Settings and Design: Pathologists (N = 7) viewed 10 digital whole slide images of breast tissue that were selected using a random stratified sampling technique to include a range of breast pathology diagnoses (benign/atypia, carcinoma in situ, and invasive breast cancer).A panel of three expert breast pathologists established a consensus diagnosis for each case using a modified Delphi approach. Materials and Methods: Participants' foveal vision was tracked using SensoMotoric Instruments RED 60 Hz eye-tracking system. Mouse cursor movement was tracked using a custom MATLAB script. Statistical Analysis Used: Data on eye-gaze and mouse cursor position were gathered at fixed intervals and analyzed using distance comparisons and regression analyses by slide diagnosis and pathologist expertise. Pathologists' accuracy (defined as percent agreement with the expert consensus diagnoses) and efficiency (accuracy and speed) were also analyzed. Results: Mean viewing time per slide was 75.2 seconds (SD = 38.42).Accuracy (percent agreement with expert consensus) by diagnosis type was: 83\% (benign/atypia); 48\% (carcinoma in situ); and 93\% (invasive). Spatial coupling was close between eye-gaze and mouse cursor positions (highest frequency {$\increment$}x was 4.00px (SD = 16.10), and {$\increment$}y was 37.50px (SD = 28.08)). Mouse cursor position moderately predicted eye gaze patterns (Rx = 0.33 and Ry = 0.21). Conclusions: Data detailing mouse cursor movements may be a useful addition to future studies of pathologists' accuracy and efficiency when using digital pathology.},

  abstract = {Genetic variants in cis-regulatory elements or trans-acting regulators frequently influence the quantity and spatiotemporal distribution of gene transcription. Recent interest in expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) mapping has paralleled the adoption of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) for the analysis of complex traits and disease in humans. Under the hypothesis that many GWAS associations tag non-coding SNPs with small effects, and that these SNPs exert phenotypic control by modifying gene expression, it has become common to interpret GWAS associations using eQTL data. To fully exploit the mechanistic interpretability of eQTL-GWAS comparisons, an improved understanding of the genetic architecture and causal mechanisms of cell type specificity of eQTLs is required. We address this need by performing an eQTL analysis in three parts: first we identified eQTLs from eleven studies on seven cell types; then we integrated eQTL data with cis-regulatory element (CRE) data from the ENCODE project; finally we built a set of classifiers to predict the cell type specificity of eQTLs. The cell type specificity of eQTLs is associated with eQTL SNP overlap with hundreds of cell type specific CRE classes, including enhancer, promoter, and repressive chromatin marks, regions of open chromatin, and many classes of DNA binding proteins. These associations provide insight into the molecular mechanisms generating the cell type specificity of eQTLs and the mode of regulation of corresponding eQTLs. Using a random forest classifier with cell specific CRE-SNP overlap as features, we demonstrate the feasibility of predicting the cell type specificity of eQTLs. We then demonstrate that CREs from a trait-associated cell type can be used to annotate GWAS associations in the absence of eQTL data for that cell type. We anticipate that such integrative, predictive modeling of cell specificity will improve our ability to understand the mechanistic basis of human complex phenotypic variation.},

A Perl scripted MySQL database was used to develop the test editor and test interface. Virtual slides were created with the Aperio ScanScope. The examination consisted of 20 questions using 20 virtual slides. Slides were chosen to represent general surgical pathology specimens from a variety of organ systems. The examination was administered in a secure environment and was completed in 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Examination reliability, as an indicator of the test's ability to discriminate between trainee ability levels, was excellent (r = 0.84). The linear correlation coefficient of virtual slide competency examination score versus months of surgical pathology training was 0.83 (P = .0001). The learning curve was much steeper early in training. Correlation of virtual slide competency examination performance with resident's performance on the 64 item Resident In-Service Examination surgical pathology subsection was 0.70. Correlation of virtual slide competency examination performance with global end of rotation ratings was 0.28. This pilot implementation demonstrates that it is possible to create a short, reliable performance-based assessment tool for measuring morphologic diagnostic skill using a virtual slide competency examination. Furthermore, the examination as implemented in our program will be a valid measure of an individual resident's progress in morphologic competency. Virtual slide technology and computer accessibility have advanced to the point that the virtual slide competency examination model implemented in our program could have applicability across multiple residency programs.},

  abstract = {A pilot study examined the extent to which eye movements occurring during interpretation of digitized breast biopsy whole slide images (WSI) can distinguish novice interpreters from experts, informing assessments of competency progression during training and across the physician-learning continuum. A pathologist with fellowship training in breast pathology interpreted digital WSI of breast tissue and marked the region of highest diagnostic relevance (dROI). These same images were then evaluated using computer vision techniques to identify visually salient regions of interest (vROI) without diagnostic relevance. A non-invasive eye tracking system recorded pathologists' (N = 7) visual behavior during image interpretation, and we measured differential viewing of vROIs versus dROIs according to their level of expertise. Pathologists with relatively low expertise in interpreting breast pathology were more likely to fixate on, and subsequently return to, diagnostically irrelevant vROIs relative to experts. Repeatedly fixating on the distracting vROI showed limited value in predicting diagnostic failure. These preliminary results suggest that eye movements occurring during digital slide interpretation can characterize expertise development by demonstrating differential attraction to diagnostically relevant versus visually distracting image regions. These results carry both theoretical implications and potential for monitoring and evaluating student progress and providing automated feedback and scanning guidance in educational settings.},

  abstract = {Digital whole slide imaging is an increasingly common medium in pathology, with application to education, telemedicine, and rendering second opinions. It has also made it possible to use eye tracking devices to explore the dynamic visual inspection and interpretation of histopathological features of tissue while pathologists review cases. Using whole slide images, the present study examined how a pathologist's diagnosis is influenced by fixed case-level factors, their prior clinical experience, and their patterns of visual inspection. Participating pathologists interpreted one of two test sets, each containing 12 digital whole slide images of breast biopsy specimens. Cases represented four diagnostic categories as determined via expert consensus: benign without atypia, atypia, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and invasive cancer. Each case included one or more regions of interest (ROIs) previously determined as of critical diagnostic importance. During pathologist interpretation we tracked eye movements, viewer tool behavior (zooming, panning), and interpretation time. Models were built using logistic and linear regression with generalized estimating equations, testing whether variables at the level of the pathologists, cases, and visual interpretive behavior would independently and/or interactively predict diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Diagnostic accuracy varied as a function of case consensus diagnosis, replicating earlier research. As would be expected, benign cases tended to elicit false positives, and atypia, DCIS, and invasive cases tended to elicit false negatives. Pathologist experience levels, case consensus diagnosis, case difficulty, eye fixation durations, and the extent to which pathologists' eyes fixated within versus outside of diagnostic ROIs, all independently or interactively predicted diagnostic accuracy. Higher zooming behavior predicted a tendency to over-interpret benign and atypia cases, but not DCIS cases. Efficiency was not predicted by pathologist- or visual search-level variables. Results provide new insights into the medical interpretive process and demonstrate the complex interactions between pathologists and cases that guide diagnostic decision-making. Implications for training, clinical practice, and computeraided decision aids are considered.},

The data also show that there are regular patterns of eye/mouse movements. Based on these findings, we argue that a mouse could provide us more information than just the x, y position where a user is pointing. This implies that we can use an inexpensive and extremely popular tool as an alternative of eye-tracking systems, especially in web usability evaluation. Moreover, by understandingthe intent of every mouse movement, we may be able to achieve a better interface for human computer interaction.},

We propose a new MOdular Bayes Screening (MOBS) approach, which involves several novel characteristics that can potentially lead to improved performance. MOBS first applies a Bayesian mixture model to the marginal distribution of the response, obtaining posterior samples of mixture weights, cluster-specific parameters, and cluster allocations for each subject. Hypothesis tests are then introduced, corresponding to whether or not to include a given predictor, with posterior probabilities for each hypothesis available analytically conditionally on unknowns sampled in the first stage and tuning parameters controlling borrowing of information across tests. By marginalizing over the first stage posterior samples, we avoid under-estimation of uncertainty typical of two-stage methods. We greatly simplify the model specification and reduce computational complexity by using modularization. We provide basic theoretical support for this approach, and illustrate excellent performance relative to competitors in simulation studies and the ability to capture complex shifts beyond simple differences in means. The method is illustrated with applications to genomics by using a very high-dimensional cis-eQTL dataset with roughly 38 million SNPs.},

Existing probabilistic approaches to interpreting these data either model all genes as zero-inflated, or none. But the overabundance of zeros might be gene-specific. Hence, we propose the AutoZI model, which, for each gene, places a spike-and-slab prior on a mixture assignment between a negative binomial (NB) component and a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) component. We approximate the posterior distribution under this model using variational inference, and employ Bayesian decision theory to decide whether each gene is zero-inflated. On simulated data, AutoZI outperforms the alternatives. On negative control data, AutoZI retrieves predictions consistent to a previous study on ERCC spike-ins and recovers similar results on control RNAs. Applied to several datasets and instances of the 10x Chromium protocol, AutoZI allows both biological and technical interpretations of zero-inflation. Finally, AutoZI's decisions on mouse embyronic stem-cells suggest that zero-inflation might be due to transcriptional bursting.},

  abstract = {CKD is the gradual, asymptomatic loss of kidney function, but current tests only identify CKD when significant loss has already happened. Several potential biomarkers of CKD have been reported, but none have been approved for preclinical or clinical use. Using RNA sequencing in a mouse model of folic acidinduced nephropathy, we identified ten genes that track kidney fibrosis development, the common pathologic finding in patients with CKD. The gene expression of all ten candidates was confirmed to be significantly higher (approximately ten- to 150-fold) in three well established, mechanistically distinct mouse models of kidney fibrosis than in models of nonfibrotic AKI. Protein expression of these genes was also high in the folic acid model and in patients with biopsy-proven kidney fibrosis. mRNA expression of the ten genes increased with increasing severity of kidney fibrosis, decreased in response to therapeutic intervention, and increased only modestly (approximately two- to five-fold) with liver fibrosis in mice and humans, demonstrating specificity for kidney fibrosis. Using targeted selected reaction monitoring mass spectrometry, we detected three of the ten candidates in human urine: cadherin 11 (CDH11), macrophage mannose receptor C1 (MRC1), and phospholipid transfer protein (PLTP). Furthermore, urinary levels of each of these three proteins distinguished patients with CKD (n=53) from healthy individuals (n=53; P,0.05). In summary, we report the identification of urinary CDH11, MRC1, and PLTP as novel noninvasive biomarkers of CKD.},

We investigated sex-specific STAT1 functions in colitis and colitis-associated colorectal cancer (CRC) using mice with specific STAT1 deletion in intestinal epithelial cells (STAT1{$\increment$}IEC).

Moreover, DSS treatment failed to induce expression of T cell-attracting chemokines in intestinal epithelial cells of male but not of female STAT1{$\increment$}IEC mice. Application of the AOM-DSS protocol for induction of colitis-associated CRC resulted in increased intestinal tumor load in male but not in female STAT1{$\increment$}IEC mice. A sex-specific stratification of human CRC patients corroborated the data obtained in mice and revealed that reduced tumor cell-intrinsic nuclear STAT1 protein expression is a poor prognostic factor in men but not in women. These data demonstrate that epithelial STAT1 is a malespecific tumor suppressor in CRC of mice and humans.},

Many early analyses of differential expression have aimed at identifying differences between subpopulations, and thus are focused on finding subpopulation markers either in a single sample or across multiple samples. More generally, such methods can compare expression levels in multiple sets of cells, thus leading to cross-condition analyses. However, given the emergence of replicated multi-condition scRNA-seq datasets, an area of increasing focus is making sample-level inferences, termed here as differential state analysis. For example, one could investigate the condition-specific responses of cell subpopulations measured from patients from each condition; however, it is not clear which statistical framework best handles this situation. In this work, we surveyed the methods available to perform cross-condition differential state analyses, including cell-level mixed models and methods based on aggregated ``pseudobulk'' data. We developed a flexible simulation platform that mimics both single and multi-sample scRNA-seq data and provide robust tools for multi-condition analysis within the muscat R package.},

These perturbations can manifest as a shift in the abundance of cells associated with a biological condition. Current computational workflows for comparative analyses typically use discrete clusters as input when testing for differential abundance between experimental conditions. However, clusters are not always an optimal representation of the biological manifold on which cells lie, especially in the context of continuous differentiation trajectories. To overcome these barriers to discovery, we present             Milo             , a flexible and scalable statistical framework that performs differential abundance testing by assigning cells to partially overlapping neighbourhoods on a k-nearest neighbour graph. Our method samples and refines neighbourhoods across the graph and leverages the flexibility of generalized linear models, making it applicable to a wide range of experimental settings. Using simulations, we show that             Milo             is both robust and sensitive, and can reveal subtle but important cell state perturbations that are obscured by discretizing cells into clusters. We illustrate the power of             Milo             by identifying the perturbed differentiation during ageing of a lineage-biased thymic epithelial precursor state and by uncovering extensive perturbation to multiple lineages in human cirrhotic liver.

It is a genuine but controversial issue in ecology particularly in the case of costly landscape-scale manipulations, behavioral studies where ethics or other concerns may limit sample sizes, ad hoc monitoring data, and the analysis of natural experiments where chance events occur at a single site. Here key publications on the topic are reviewed to illustrate the debate that exists about the conceptual validity of pseudoreplication. A survey of ecologists and case studies of experimental design and publication issues are used to explore the extent of the problem, ecologists' solutions, reviewers' attitudes, and the fate of submitted manuscripts. Scientists working across a range of ecological disciplines regularly come across the problem of pseudoreplication and build solutions into their designs and analyses. These include carefully defining hypotheses and the population of interest, acknowledging the limits of statistical inference and using statistical approaches including nesting and random effects. Many ecologists face considerable challenges getting their work published if accusations of pseudoreplication are made \textendash{} even if the problem has been dealt with. Many reviewers reject papers for pseudoreplication, and this occurs more often if they haven't experienced the issue themselves. The concept of pseudoreplication is being applied too dogmatically and often leads to rejection during review. There is insufficient consideration of the associated philosophical issues and potential statistical solutions. By stopping the publication of ecological studies, reviewers are slowing the pace of ecological research and limiting the scope of management case studies, natural events studies, and valuable data available to form evidence-based solutions. Recommendations for fair and consistent treatment of pseudoreplication during writing and review are given for authors, reviewers, and editors.},

By 2000, the progressive decrease in use of traditional microscopy in medical student education had set the stage for the entry of virtual microscopy into medical schools. Since that time, it has been successfully implemented into many pathology courses in the United States and around the world, with surveys indicating that about 50\% of pathology courses already have or expect to implement virtual microscopy. Over the last decade, in addition to an increasing ability to emulate traditional microscopy, virtual microscopy has allowed educators to take advantage of the accessibility, efficiency, and pedagogic versatility of the computer and the Internet. The cost of virtual microscopy in education is now quite reasonable after taking into account replacement cost for microscopes, maintenance of glass slides, and the fact that 1-dimensional microscope space can be converted to multiuse computer laboratories or research. Although the current technology for implementation of virtual microscopy in histopathology education is very good, it could be further improved upon by better low-power screen resolution and depth of field. Nevertheless, virtual microscopy is beginning to play an increasing role in continuing education, house staff education, and evaluation of competency in histopathology. As Z-axis viewing (focusing) becomes more efficient, virtual microscopy will also become integrated into education in cytology, hematology, microbiology, and urinalysis. \textcopyright{} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

In Experiment 1, the CAD system's primary function was to tell observers where the target might be. In Experiment 2, CAD provided information about target identity. Results\textemdash In Experiment 1, there was a significant enhancement of observer sensitivity in the presence of CAD (t(22)=4.74, p{$<$}.001), but there was also a substantial cost. Targets that were not marked by the CAD system were missed more frequently than equivalent targets in No CAD blocks of the experiment (t(22)=7.02, p{$<$}.001). Experiment 2 showed no behavioral benefit from CAD, but also no significant cost on sensitivity to unmarked targets (t(22)=0.6, p=n.s.).

  abstract = {Background: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) presents two subtypes which have drastically different clinical outcomes, IgVH mutated (M-CLL) and IgVH unmutated (U-CLL). So far, these two subtypes are not associated to clear differences in gene expression profiles. Interestingly, recent results have highlighted important roles for heterogeneity, both at the genetic and at the epigenetic level in CLL progression. Methods: We analyzed gene expression data of two large cohorts of CLL patients and quantified expression variability across individuals to investigate differences between the two subtypes using different measures and statistical tests. Functional significance was explored by pathway enrichment and network analyses. Furthermore, we implemented a random forest approach based on expression variability to classify patients into disease subtypes. Results: We found that U-CLL, the more aggressive type of the disease, shows significantly increased variability of gene expression across patients and that, overall, genes that show higher variability in the aggressive subtype are related to cell cycle, development and inter-cellular communication. These functions indicate a potential relation between gene expression variability and the faster progression of this CLL subtype. Finally, a classifier based on gene expression variability was able to correctly predict the disease subtype of CLL patients. Conclusions: There are strong relations between gene expression variability and disease subtype linking significantly increased expression variability to phenotypes such as aggressiveness and resistance to therapy in CLL.},

  abstract = {Background: A healthy immune system requires immune cells that adapt rapidly to environmental challenges. This phenotypic plasticity can be mediated by transcriptional and epigenetic variability. Results: We apply a novel analytical approach to measure and compare transcriptional and epigenetic variability genome-wide across CD14+CD16- monocytes, CD66b+CD16+ neutrophils, and CD4+CD45RA+ na\"ive T cells from the same 125 healthy individuals. We discover substantially increased variability in neutrophils compared to monocytes and T cells. In neutrophils, genes with hypervariable expression are found to be implicated in key immune pathways and are associated with cellular properties and environmental exposure. We also observe increased sex-specific gene expression differences in neutrophils. Neutrophil-specific DNA methylation hypervariable sites are enriched at dynamic chromatin regions and active enhancers. Conclusions: Our data highlight the importance of transcriptional and epigenetic variability for the key role of neutrophils as the first responders to inflammatory stimuli. We provide a resource to enable further functional studies into the plasticity of immune cells, which can be accessed from: http://blueprint-dev.bioinfo.cnio.es/WP10/hypervariability.},

Recently, next generation sequencing technologies are revolutionizing the DNA/RNA sequencing tasks. These highly efficient parallel sequencing methods make it possible to generate billions of bases of sequence per day in a biological laboratory.

Which statistical philosophy will dominate practice? My guess, backed up with some recent examples, is that a combination of Bayesian and frequentist ideas will be needed to deal with our increasingly intense scientific environment. This will be a challenging period for statisticians, both applied and theoretical, but it also opens the opportunity for a new golden age, rivaling that of Fisher, Neyman, and the other giants of the early 1900's.

Singlecell RNA sequencing can characterize this variability in a transcriptome-wide manner. However, technical variation and the confounding between variability and mean expression estimates hinder meaningful comparison of expression variability between cell populations. To address this problem, we introduce an analysis approach that extends the BASiCS statistical framework to derive a residual measure of variability that is not confounded by mean expression. This includes a robust procedure for quantifying technical noise in experiments where technical spike-in molecules are not available. We illustrate how our method provides biological insight into the dynamics of cell-to-cell expression variability, highlighting a synchronization of biosynthetic machinery components in immune cells upon activation. In contrast to the uniform up-regulation of the biosynthetic machinery, CD4+ T cells show heterogeneous up-regulation of immune-related and lineage-defining genes during activation and differentiation.},

However, some key characteristics of the human visual system (HVS) are still neglected in building these saliency detection models. In this paper, we propose a new saliency detection model based on the human visual sensitivity and the amplitude spectrum of quaternion Fourier transform (QFT). We use the amplitude spectrum of QFT to represent the color, intensity, and orientation distributions for image patches. The saliency value for each image patch is calculated by not only the differences between the QFT amplitude spectrum of this patch and other patches in the whole image, but also the visual impacts for these differences determined by the human visual sensitivity. The experiment results show that the proposed saliency detection model outperforms the state-of-the-art detection models. In addition, we apply our proposed model in the application of image retargeting and achieve better performance over the conventional algorithms.},

  abstract = {Many complex human traits exhibit differences between sexes. While numerous factors likely contribute to this phenomenon, growing evidence from genome-wide studies suggest a partial explanation: that males and females from the same population possess differing genetic architectures. Despite this, mapping gene-by-sex (G3S) interactions remains a challenge likely because the magnitude of such an interaction is typically and exceedingly small; traditional genome-wide association techniques may be underpowered to detect such events, due partly to the burden of multiple test correction. Here, we developed a local Bayesian regression (LBR) method to estimate sex-specific SNP marker effects after fully accounting for local linkage-disequilibrium (LD) patterns. This enabled us to infer sex-specific effects and G3S interactions either at the single SNP level, or by aggregating the effects of multiple SNPs to make inferences at the level of small LD-based regions. Using simulations in which there was imperfect LD between SNPs and causal variants, we showed that aggregating sex-specific marker effects with LBR provides improved power and resolution to detect G3S interactions over traditional single-SNP-based tests. When using LBR to analyze traits from the UK Biobank, we detected a relatively large G3S interaction impacting bone mineral density within ABO, and replicated many previously detected large-magnitude G3S interactions impacting waist-to-hip ratio. We also discovered many new G3S interactions impacting such traits as height and body mass index (BMI) within regions of the genome where both male- and female-specific effects explain a small proportion of phenotypic variance (R2 , 1 3 1024), but are enriched in known expression quantitative trait loci.},

  abstract = {For analyses of longitudinal repeated-measures data, statistical methods include the random effects model, fixed effects model and the method of generalized estimating equations. We examine the assumptions that underlie these approaches to assessing covariate effects on the mean of a continuous, dichotomous or count outcome. Access to statistical software to implement these models has led to widespread application in numerous disciplines. However, careful consideration should be paid to their critical assumptions to ascertain which model might be appropriate in a given setting. To illustrate similarities and differences that might exist in empirical results, we use a study that assessed depressive symptoms in low-income pregnant women using a structured instrument with up to five assessments that spanned the pre-natal and post-natal periods. Understanding the conceptual differences between the methods is important in their proper application even though empirically they might not differ substantively. The choice of model in specific applications would depend on the relevant questions being addressed, which in turn informs the type of design and data collection that would be relevant.

Areas highlighted include the application of single-cell genomics to interrogate microbial dark matter and to evaluate the pathogenic roles of genetic mosaicism in multicellular organisms, with a focus on cancer.

We generalize linear response methods from statistical physics to deliver accurate uncertainty estimates for model variables\textemdash both for individual variables and coherently across variables. We call our method linear response variational Bayes (LRVB). When the MFVB posterior approximation is in the exponential family, LRVB has a simple, analytic form, even for non-conjugate models. Indeed, we make no assumptions about the form of the true posterior. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of our method on a range of models for both simulated and real data.},

In these cases the variance partitions are dependent on predictors associated with the individual observation. We compare several computational techniques to compute the variance partitions.},

  abstract = {Background: Because driver mutations provide selective advantage to the mutant clone, they tend to occur at a higher frequency in tumor samples compared to selectively neutral (passenger) mutations. However, mutation frequency alone is insufficient to identify cancer genes because mutability is influenced by many gene characteristics, such as size, nucleotide composition, etc. The goal of this study was to identify gene characteristics associated with the frequency of somatic mutations in the gene in tumor samples. Results: We used data on somatic mutations detected by genome wide screens from the Catalog of Somatic Mutations in Cancer (COSMIC). Gene size, nucleotide composition, expression level of the gene, relative replication time in the cell cycle, level of evolutionary conservation and other gene characteristics (totaling 11) were used as predictors of the number of somatic mutations. We applied stepwise multiple linear regression to predict the number of mutations per gene. Because missense, nonsense, and frameshift mutations are associated with different sets of gene characteristics, they were modeled separately. Gene characteristics explain 88\% of the variation in the number of missense, 40\% of nonsense, and 23\% of frameshift mutations. Comparisons of the observed and expected numbers of mutations identified genes with a higher than expected number of mutations\textendash{} positive outliers. Many of these are known driver genes. A number of novel candidate driver genes was also identified. Conclusions: By comparing the observed and predicted number of mutations in a gene, we have identified known cancer-associated genes as well as 111 novel cancer associated genes. We also showed that adding the number of silent mutations per gene reported by genome/exome wide screens across all cancer type (COSMIC data) as a predictor substantially exceeds predicting accuracy of the most popular cancer gene predicting tool - MutsigCV.},

Consistent with previous findings in psychology about the nature of attentional engagement in TV viewing, baseline hazard rates are found to be non-monotonic. In addition, the data show considerable ad-to-ad and household-to-household heterogeneity in zapping behavior. While one of the datasets contains some information on characteristics of the ads, these data do not reveal any firm links between the ad heterogeneity and the ad characteristics. A number of methodological and computational issues arise in the hierarchical Bayes analysis.},

To address this, we present a modeling framework for the normalization and variance stabilization of molecular count data from scRNA-seq experiments. We propose that the Pearson residuals from ``regularized negative binomial regression,'' where cellular sequencing depth is utilized as a covariate in a generalized linear model, successfully remove the influence of technical characteristics from downstream analyses while preserving biological heterogeneity. Importantly, we show that an unconstrained negative binomial model may overfit scRNA-seq data, and overcome this by pooling information across genes with similar abundances to obtain stable parameter estimates. Our procedure omits the need for heuristic steps including pseudocount addition or log-transformation and improves common downstream analytical tasks such as variable gene selection, dimensional reduction, and differential expression. Our approach can be applied to any UMI-based scRNA-seq dataset and is freely available as part of the R package sctransform, with a direct interface to our single-cell toolkit Seurat.},

A variety of image analysis applications are reviewed including nuclear morphometry and tissue architecture analysis, but with emphasis on immunohistochemistry and fluorescence analysis of tissue biomarkers. Digital pathology and image analysis have important roles across the drug/companion diagnostic development pipeline including biobanking, molecular pathology, tissue microarray analysis, molecular profiling of tissue and these important developments are reviewed. Underpinning all of these important developments is the need for high quality tissue samples and the impact of pre-analytical variables on tissue research is discussed. This requirement is combined with practical advice on setting up and running a digital pathology laboratory. Finally, we discuss the need to integrate digital image analysis data with epidemiological, clinical and genomic data in order to fully understand the relationship between genotype and phenotype and to drive discovery and the delivery of personalized medicine.},

  abstract = {The ability to measure gene expression on a genome-wide scale is one of the most promising accomplishments in molecular biology. Microarrays, the technology that first permitted this, were riddled with problems due to unwanted sources of variability. Many of these problems are now mitigated, after a decade's worth of statistical methodology development. The recently developed RNA sequencing (RNAseq) technology has generated much excitement in part due to claims of reduced variability in comparison to microarrays. However, we show that RNA-seq data demonstrate unwanted and obscuring variability similar to what was first observed in microarrays. In particular, we find guanine-cytosine content (GCcontent) has a strong sample-specific effect on gene expression measurements that, if left uncorrected, leads to false positives in downstream results. We also report on commonly observed data distortions that demonstrate the need for data normalization. Here, we describe a statistical methodology that improves precision by 42\% without loss of accuracy. Our resulting conditional quantile normalization algorithm combines robust generalized regression to remove systematic bias introduced by deterministic features such as GC-content and quantile normalization to correct for global distortions.},

Despite this increase in popularity, several studies suggested that Internet users `avoid' looking at ads (what is often referred to as the banner blindness phenomena). This conclusion, however, rests mostly on indirect evidence that participants do not remember the ad content. Therefore, it is unclear whether participants actually fixated the ads and how their gaze behaviour is related to memory for the ad. In the present study, we investigated whether Internet users avoid looking at ads inserted on a non-search website using an analysis of eye movements, and if the ad content is kept in memory. Our results show that most participants fixate the ads at least once during their website visit. Moreover, even though the congruency between the ad and the editorial content had no effect on fixation duration on the ad, congruent ads were better memorised than incongruent ads. This study provides a novel and systematic method for assessing the processing and retention of advertisements during a website visit. Copyright \# 2010 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Our sketches provide more comprehensive visualization of transcriptional diversity, capture rare cell types with high sensitivity, and accurately reveal biological cell types via clustering. Our sketch of umbilical cord blood cells uncovers a rare subpopulation of inflammatory macrophages, which we experimentally validated             in vitro             . The construction of our sketches is extremely fast, which enabled us to accelerate other crucial resource-intensive tasks such as scRNA-seq data integration. We anticipate that our algorithm will become an increasingly essential step when sharing and analyzing the rapidly-growing volume of scRNA-seq data and help enable the democratization of single-cell omics.},

We recognize that the ideal normalization, if it ever exists, would aim to keep the maximal amount of gene profile information with the lowest possible noise. With this objective in mind, we propose a valuable enhancement to quantile normalization, and demonstrate through three Affymetrix experiments that the enhanced normalization can result in better performance in detecting and ranking differentially expressed genes across experimental conditions.},

However, cursor interactions are not all the same; different types of cursor behavior patterns exist, such as reading, hesitating, scrolling and clicking, each of which has a different meaning. We conduct a search study with 36 subjects and 32 search tasks to determine when gaze and cursor are aligned, and thus when the cursor position is a good proxy for gaze position. We study the effect of time, behavior patterns, user, and search task on the gaze-cursor alignment, findings which lead us to question the maxim that ``gaze is well approximated by cursor.'' These lessons inform an experiment in which we predict the gaze position with better accuracy than simply using the cursor position, improving the state-of-the-art technique for approximating visual attention with the cursor. Our new technique can help make better use of large-scale cursor data in identifying how users examine Web search pages.},

To reconstruct the sample identify of each cell, genetic variants that segregate between the samples in the pool have been proposed as natural barcode for cell demultiplexing. Existing demultiplexing strategies rely on availability of complete genotype data from the pooled samples, which limits the applicability of such methods, in particular when genetic variation is not the primary object of study. To address this, we here present Vireo, a computationally efficient Bayesian model to demultiplex single-cell data from pooled experimental designs. Uniquely, our model can be applied in settings when only partial or no genotype information is available. Using pools based on synthetic mixtures and results on real data, we demonstrate the robustness of Vireo and illustrate the utility of multiplexed experimental designs for common expression analyses.},

In order to adjust for these extra zero counts, various modifications of the Poisson regression model have been proposed. Lambert (Lambert, D., Technometrics 34, 1\textendash 14, 1992) described a zero-inflated Poisson (ZIP) model that is based on a mixture of a binary distribution ({$\pi$}i ) degenerated at zero with a Poisson distribution ({$\lambda$}i ). Depending on the relationship between {$\pi$}i and {$\lambda$}i , she described two variants: a ZIP and a ZIP ({$\tau$} ) model. In this paper, we extend these models for the case of clustered data (e.g., patients observed within hospitals) and describe random-effects ZIP and ZIP ({$\tau$} ) models. These models are appropriate for the analysis of clustered extra-zero Poisson count data. The distribution of the random effects is assumed to be normal and a maximum marginal likelihood estimation method is used to estimate the model parameters. We applied these models to data from patients who underwent colon operations from 123 Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in the National VA Surgical Quality Improvement Program.},

In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27\% of them, or 48\% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict randomization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre-layout (or conventional) and layout-specific alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological journals as to how ecologists' understanding of experimental design and statistics might be improved.

Molecular imaging by mass spectrometry is one such growth area. The development of a capability for 2D chemical imaging of surfaces is described, based on the combination of a desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) ion source with an automated surface stage capable of x, y translational motion. The lateral resolution of this new system is found to be less than 200 microns, using a test ink pattern. Chemical imaging of surfaces is demonstrated using model examples of organic and biological systems: (i) imaging of a 2D pattern written in different colored inks on photographic paper and (ii) imaging of thin coronal sections of rat brain tissue fixed onto a glass microscope slide. In both cases, full mass spectra are recorded as a function of x,y-position on the surface. In the chemical imaging example, the distributions of the two different inks on the paper surface were mapped by tracking the abundance of the intact organic cation which characterizes each particular ink dye. In the tissue imaging example, distributions of specific lipids in coronal sections of rat brain tissue were followed from the abundance distributions in 2D space of the deprotonated lipid molecules recorded in the negative ion mass spectra. These latter distributions reveal distinct anatomical features of the rat brain. The results of these studies demonstrate the feasibility of performing surface imaging studies using DESI and show that at this stage of its development it has a lateral spatial resolution of a few hundred microns.},

One of the key challenges is to ensure that only single, live cells are included in downstream analysis, as the inclusion of compromised cells inevitably affects data interpretation. Here, we present a generic approach for processing scRNA-seq data and detecting low quality cells, using a curated set of over 20 biological and technical features. Our approach improves classification accuracy by over 30 \% compared to traditional methods when tested on over 5,000 cells, including CD4+ T cells, bone marrow dendritic cells, and mouse embryonic stem cells.},

  abstract = {In this paper we report exploratory analyses of high-density oligonucleotide array data from the Affymetrix GeneChip R system with the objective of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip R arrays, part of the data from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip R arrays; and part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A GeneChip R arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect match and mismatch probe (P M and M M) values of these data, and examine the variance\textendash mean relationship with probe-level data from probes believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level intensities. We then examine the behavior of the P M and M M using spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's (i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii) the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI). The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a new summary measure that is a robust multiarray average (RMA) of background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed P M values. We evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and (for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE) to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific affinities.},

  abstract = {The development of tools in computational pathology to assist physicians and biomedical scientists in the diagnosis of disease requires access to high-quality annotated images for algorithm learning and evaluation. Generating high-quality expert-derived annotations is time-consuming and expensive. We explore the use of crowdsourcing for rapidly obtaining annotations for two core tasks in computational pathology: nucleus detection and nucleus segmentation. We designed and implemented crowdsourcing experiments using the CrowdFlower platform, which provides access to a large set of labor channel partners that accesses and manages millions of contributors worldwide. We obtained annotations from four types of annotators and compared concordance across these groups. We obtained: crowdsourced annotations for nucleus detection and segmentation on a total of 810 images; annotations using automated methods on 810 images; annotations from research fellows for detection and segmentation on 477 and 455 images, respectively; and expert pathologist-derived annotations for detection and segmentation on 80 and 63 images, respectively. For the crowdsourced annotations, we evaluated performance across a range of contributor skill levels (1, 2, or 3). The crowdsourced annotations (4,860 images in total) were completed in only a fraction of the time and cost required for obtaining annotations using traditional methods. For the nucleus detection task, the research fellow-derived annotations showed the strongest concordance with the expert pathologistderived annotations (F-M =93.68\%), followed by the crowd-sourced contributor levels 1,2, and 3 and the automated method, which showed relatively similar performance (F-M = 87.84\%, 88.49\%, 87.26\%, and 86.99\%, respectively). For the nucleus segmentation task, the crowdsourced contributor level 3-derived annotations, research fellow-derived annotations, and automated method showed the strongest concordance with the expert pathologist-derived annotations (F-M = 66.41\%, 65.93\%, and 65.36\%, respectively), followed by the contributor levels 2 and 1 (60.89\% and 60.87\%, respectively). When the research fellows were used as a gold-standard for the segmentation task, all three contributor levels of the crowdsourced annotations significantly outperformed the automated method (F-M = 62.21\%, 62.47\%, and 65.15\% vs. 51.92\%). Aggregating multiple annotations from the crowd to obtain a consensus annotation resulted in the strongest performance for the crowd-sourced segmentation. For both detection and segmentation, crowd-sourced performance is strongest with small images (400 x 400 pixels) and degrades significantly with the use of larger images (600 x 600 and 800 x 800 pixels). We conclude that crowdsourcing to non-experts can be used for large-scale labeling microtasks in computational pathology and offers a new approach for the rapid generation of labeled images for algorithm development and evaluation.},

Competition among neurons in this map gives rise to a single winning location that corresponds to the next attended target. Inhibiting this location automatically allows the system to attend to the next most salient location. We describe a detailed computer implementation of such a scheme, focusing on the problem of combining information across modalities, here orientation, intensity and color information, in a purely stimulus-driven manner. The model is applied to common psychophysical stimuli as well as to a very demanding visual search task. Its successful performance is used to address the extent to which the primate visual system carries out visual search via one or more such saliency maps and how this can be tested. \textcopyright{} 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

As a result, characteristics of expert behaviour are often described as either cognitive or visual abilities. This study focuses on both aspects of expertise and analyses them along three overarching constructs: (1) encapsulations, (2) efficiency, and (3) hypothesis testing. This study was carried out among clinical pathologists performing an authentic task: diagnosing microscopic slides. Participants were 13 clinical pathologists (experts), 12 residents in pathology (intermediates), and 13 medical students (novices). They all diagnosed seven cases in a virtual microscope and gave post hoc explanations for their diagnoses. The collected data included eye movements, microscope navigation, and verbal protocols. Results showed that experts used lower magnifications and verbalized their findings as diagnoses. Also, their diagnostic paths were more efficient, including fewer microscope movements and shorter reasoning chains. Experts entered relevant areas later in their diagnostic process, and visited fewer of them. Intermediates used relatively high magnifications and based their diagnoses on specific abnormalities. Also, they took longer to reach their diagnosis and checked more relevant areas. Novices searched in detail, described findings by their appearances, and uttered long reasoning chains. These results indicate that overarching constructs can justly be identified: encapsulations and efficiency are apparent in both visual and cognitive aspects of expertise.},

It is common to control computation time by making approximations to the Markov transition kernel. Comparatively little attention has been paid to computational optimality in these approximating Markov Chains, or when such approximations are justified relative to obtaining shorter paths from the exact kernel. We give simple, sharp bounds for uniform approximations of uniformly mixing Markov chains. We then suggest a notion of optimality that incorporates computation time and approximation error, and use our bounds to make generalizations about properties of good approximations in the uniformly mixing setting. The relevance of these properties is demonstrated in applications to a minibatching-based approximate MCMC algorithm for large n logistic regression and low-rank approximations for Gaussian processes.},

  abstract = {The horseshoe prior is frequently employed in Bayesian analysis of high-dimensional models, and has been shown to achieve minimax optimal risk properties when the truth is sparse. While optimization-based algorithms for the extremely popular Lasso and elastic net procedures can scale to dimension in the hundreds of thousands, algorithms for the horseshoe that use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for computation are limited to problems an order of magnitude smaller. This is due to high computational cost per step and growth of the variance of time-averaging estimators as a function of dimension. We propose two new MCMC algorithms for computation in these models that have improved performance compared to existing alternatives. One of the algorithms also approximates an expensive matrix product to give orders of magnitude speedup in highdimensional applications. We prove that the exact algorithm is geometrically ergodic, and give guarantees for the accuracy of the approximate algorithm using perturbation theory. Versions of the approximation algorithm that gradually decrease the approximation error as the chain extends are shown to be exact. The scalability of the algorithm is illustrated in simulations with problem size as large as N `` 5, 000 observations and p `` 50, 000 predictors, and an application to a genome-wide association study with N `` 2, 267 and p `` 98, 385. The empirical results also show that the new algorithm yields estimates with lower mean squared error, intervals with better coverage, and elucidates features of the posterior that were often missed by previous algorithms in high dimensions, including bimodality of posterior marginals indicating uncertainty about which covariates belong in the model.},

The ability to combine microarray data sets is advantageous to researchers to increase statistical power to detect biological phenomena from studies where logistical considerations restrict sample size or in studies that require the sequential hybridization of arrays. In general, it is inappropriate to combine data sets without adjusting for batch effects. Methods have been proposed to filter batch effects from data, but these are often complicated and require large batch sizes ({$>$}25) to implement. Because the majority of microarray studies are conducted using much smaller sample sizes, existing methods are not sufficient. We propose parametric and non-parametric empirical Bayes frameworks for adjusting data for batch effects that is robust to outliers in small sample sizes and performs comparable to existing methods for large samples. We illustrate our methods using two example data sets and show that our methods are justifiable, easy to apply, and useful in practice.

However, limitations of the technology result in sparse CpG coverage, effectively posing challenges to robustly quantify genuine DNA methylation heterogeneity. Here we tackle these issues by introducing scMET, a hierarchical Bayesian model which overcomes data sparsity by sharing information across cells and genomic features, resulting in a robust and biologically interpretable quantification of variability. scMET can be used to both identify highly variable features that drive epigenetic heterogeneity and perform differential methylation and differential variability analysis between pre-specified groups of cells. We demonstrate scMET's effectiveness on some recent large scale single cell methylation datasets, showing that the scMET feature selection approach facilitates the characterisation epigenetically distinct cell populations. Moreover, we illustrate how scMET variability estimates enable the formulation of novel biological hypotheses on the epigenetic regulation of gene expression in early development. An R package implementation of scMET is publicly available at https://github.com/andreaskapou/scMET.},

  abstract = {The ability to learn tasks in a sequential fashion is crucial to the development of artificial intelligence. Neural networks are not, in general, capable of this and it has been widely thought that catastrophic forgetting is an inevitable feature of connectionist models. We show that it is possible to overcome this limitation and train networks that can maintain expertise on tasks which they have not experienced for a long time. Our approach remembers old tasks by selectively slowing down learning on the weights important for those tasks. We demonstrate our approach is scalable and effective by solving a set of classification tasks based on the MNIST hand written digit dataset and by learning several Atari 2600 games sequentially.},

Importantly, these sex-based immunological differences contribute to variations in the incidence of autoimmune diseases and malignancies, susceptibility to infectious diseases and responses to vaccines in males and females.

There are, however, few studies comparing its diagnostic accuracy and acceptability compared with traditional glass slides. This study sought to compare residents' abilities in diagnosing dermatopathology disorders in 2 image formats (traditional microscopic slides and whole mount digitized images) and to assess their perceptions of virtual microscopy in dermatopathology. Residents in dermatology and pathology training programs at 14 institutions were given a randomized combination of 20 virtual and glass slides and were asked to identify the diagnoses from multiple foils. They were then asked to give their impressions about the virtual images. Descriptive data analysis and comparison of groups using Pearson {$\chi$}2 and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables and Student t test for continuous variables were performed. Residents in dermatology and pathology performed similarly in diagnosing dermatopathology disorders using virtual slides or glass slides (mean [SD] correct for virtual versus glass, 5.48 (1.72) versus 5.57 (2.06); P = .70). The order of administration of virtual versus glass slides did not affect the percentage of questions answered correctly. Most residents supported the use of virtual microscopy as a learning aid, whereas fewer favored its use in testing (79\% versus 44\%, respectively). Residents performed similarly in making dermatologic diagnoses using virtual slides compared with glass slides despite the residents' preference for the latter.},

This study investigates the bottom-up effects of three types of images on viewing patterns of students, residents and radiologists: focal diseases (localized abnormality), diffuse diseases (distributed abnormality) and images showing no abnormalities (normal). Participants inspected conventional chest radiographs while their eye movements were recorded. Regardless of expertise, in focal diseases, participants fixated relatively long at specific locations, whereas in diffuse diseases, fixations were more dispersed and shorter. Moreover, for students, dispersion of fixations was higher on diffuse compared with normal images, whereas for residents and radiologists, dispersion was highest on normal images. Despite this difference, students showed relatively high performance on normal images but low performance on focal and diffuse images. Viewing patterns were strongly influenced by bottom-up stimulus effects. Although viewing behavior of students was similar to that of radiologists, they lack knowledge that helps them diagnose the disease correctly.

We find that the cellular transcriptomes of cells grown in these conditions are distinct, with 2i being the most similar to blastocyst cells and including a subpopulation resembling the two-cell embryo state. Overall levels of intercellular gene expression heterogeneity are comparable across the three conditions. However, this masks variable expression of pluripotency genes in serum cells and homogeneous expression in 2i and a2i cells. Additionally, genes related to the cell cycle are more variably expressed in the 2i and a2i conditions. Mining of our dataset for correlations in gene expression allowed us to identify additional components of the pluripotency network, including Ptma and Zfp640, illustrating its value as a resource for future discovery.},

The important contributions of this paper are: evaluation and comparison of performance of five algorithms to classify specific oculomotor behavior; introduction and comparison of new standardized scores to provide more reliable classification performance; logic for a reasonable threshold-value selection for any eye-movement classification algorithm based on the standardized scores; and logic for establishing a criterion-based baseline for performance comparison between any eye-movement classification algorithms.

A series of 20 digitized breast biopsy whole slide images (half benign and half malignant biopsies) were individually shown to 4 pathology residents at four points in time\textemdash at the beginning of their first, second, third, and fourth years of residency. Their task was to examine each image and select three areas that they would most want to zoom in on in order to view the diagnostic detail at higher resolution. Eye position was recorded as they scanned each whole slide image at low magnification. The data indicate that with each successive year of experience, the residents' search patterns do change. Overall, with time, it takes significantly less time to view an individual slide and decide where to zoom, significantly fewer fixations are generated overall, and there is less examination of nondiagnostic areas. Essentially, the residents' search becomes much more efficient. These findings are similar to those in radiology, and support the theory that an important aspect of the development of expertise is improved pattern recognition (taking in more information during the initial Gestalt or gist view) as well as improved allocation of attention and visual processing resources. Progression in improvements in visual search strategies was similar, but not identical, for the 4 residents.},

Both students and teaching staff readily adapted to the use of virtual microscopy. Questionnaire feedback from students strongly indicated that virtual slides solved a number of problems in their learning, while providing good to excellent image quality. A deliberate policy of allocating two students per workstation promoted collaboration and helped to maintain interest in microscopic pathology. The use of a secure browser facilitated assessment using virtual slides, with no technical or security issues arising despite high peak demand. The new Medicine programme at the University of New South Wales will exclusively utilize virtual microscopy for the study of both histology and histopathology.

  abstract = {Standard preprocessing of single-cell RNA-seq UMI data includes normalization by sequencing depth to remove this technical variability, and nonlinear transformation to stabilize the variance across genes with different expression levels. Instead, two recent papers propose to use statistical count models for these tasks: Hafemeister and Satija (2019) recommend using Pearson residuals from negative binomial regression, while Townes et al. (2019) recommend fitting a generalized PCA model. Here, we investigate the connection between these approaches theoretically and empirically, and compare their effects on downstream processing. We show that the model of Hafemeister and Satija (2019) produces noisy parameter estimates because it is overspecified (which is why the original paper employs post-hoc regularization). When specified more parsimoniously, it has a simple analytic solution equivalent to the rank-one Poisson GLM-PCA of Townes et al. (2019). Further, our analysis indicates that per-gene overdispersion estimates in Hafemeister and Satija (2019) are biased, and that the data analyzed in that paper are in fact consistent with constant overdispersion parameter across genes. We then use negative control data without biological variability to estimate the technical overdispersion of UMI counts, and find that across several different experimental protocols, the data suggest very moderate overdispersion. Finally, we argue that analytic Pearson residuals (or, equivalently, rank-one GLM-PCA or negative binomial regression after regularization) strongly outperform standard preprocessing for identifying biologically variable genes, and capture more biologically meaningful variation when used for dimensionality reduction, compared to other methods.},

This can occur when there are multiple observations on the same subjects, when samples are nested or hierarchically organised, or when measurements are correlated in time or space. Analysis of such data without taking these dependencies into account can lead to meaningless results, and examples can easily be found in the neuroscience literature. Results: A single issue of Nature Neuroscience provided a number of examples and is used as a case study to highlight how pseudoreplication arises in neuroscientific studies, why the analyses in these papers are incorrect, and appropriate analytical methods are provided. 12\% of papers had pseudoreplication and a further 36\% were suspected of having pseudoreplication, but it was not possible to determine for certain because insufficient information was provided. Conclusions: Pseudoreplication can undermine the conclusions of a statistical analysis, and it would be easier to detect if the sample size, degrees of freedom, the test statistic, and precise p-values are reported. This information should be a requirement for all publications.},

Here we argue that his insight may also be relevant for understanding evolved biological systems, and we present a `fluctuation\textendash response relationship' for biology. The relationship is consistent with the idea that biological systems are similarly canalized to stochastic, environmental, and genetic perturbations. It is also supported by in silico evolution experiments, and by the observation that `noisy' gene expression is often both more responsive and more `evolvable'. More generally, we argue that in biology there is (and always has been) an important role for macroscopic theory that considers the general behavior of systems without concern for their intimate molecular details.},

However, understanding brain function, development, and disease will require linking molecular cell types to morphological, physiological, and behavioral correlates. Emerging spatially resolved transcriptomic methods promise to fill this gap by localizing molecularly defined cell types in tissues, with simultaneous detection of morphology, activity, or connectivity.

  abstract = {Variations in gene expression level might lead to phenotypic diversity across individuals or populations. Although many human genes are found to have differential mRNA levels between populations, the extent of gene expression that could vary within and between populations largely remains elusive. To investigate the dynamic range of gene expression, we analyzed the expression variability of ,18, 000 human genes across individuals within HapMap populations. Although ,20\% of human genes show differentiated mRNA levels between populations, our results show that expression variability of most human genes in one population is not significantly deviant from another population, except for a small fraction that do show substantially higher expression variability in a particular population. By associating expression variability with sequence polymorphism, intriguingly, we found SNPs in the untranslated regions (59 and 39UTRs) of these variable genes show consistently elevated population heterozygosity. We performed differential expression analysis on a genome-wide scale, and found substantially reduced expression variability for a large number of genes, prohibiting them from being differentially expressed between populations. Functional analysis revealed that genes with the greatest within-population expression variability are significantly enriched for chemokine signaling in HIV-1 infection, and for HIV-interacting proteins that control viral entry, replication, and propagation. This observation combined with the finding that known human HIV host factors show substantially elevated expression variability, collectively suggest that gene expression variability might explain differential HIV susceptibility across individuals.},

However, such bottom-up solutions are often insufficient since the prior knowledge, which often indicates a biased selectivity on the input stimuli, is not taken into account. To solve this problem, this paper presents a novel approach to estimate image saliency by learning the prior knowledge. In our approach, the influences of the visual stimuli and the prior knowledge are jointly incorporated into a Bayesian framework. In this framework, the bottom-up saliency is calculated to pop-out the visual subsets that are probably salient, while the prior knowledge is used to recover the wrongly suppressed targets and inhibit the improperly popped-out distractors. Compared with existing approaches, the prior knowledge used in our approach, including the foreground prior and the correlation prior, is statistically learned from 9.6 million images in an unsupervised manner. Experimental results on two public benchmarks show that such statistical priors are effective to modulate the bottomup saliency to achieve impressive improvements when compared with 10 state-of-the-art methods.},

  abstract = {Background: Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified various genes associated with asthma, yet, causal genes or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) remain elusive. We sought to dissect functional genes/SNPs for asthma by combining expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) and GWASs. Methods: Cis-eQTL analyses of 34 asthma genes were performed in cells from human bronchial epithelial biopsy (BEC, n = 107) and from bronchial alveolar lavage (BAL, n = 94). Results: For TSLP-WDR36 region, rs3806932 (G allele protective against eosinophilic esophagitis) and rs2416257 (A allele associated with lower eosinophil counts and protective against asthma) were correlated with decreased expression of TSLP in BAL (P = 7.9 9 10\`A11 and 5.4 9 10\`A4, respectively) and BEC, but not WDR36. Surprisingly, rs1837253 (consistently associated with asthma) showed no correlation with TSLP expression levels. For ORMDL3-GSDMB region, rs8067378 (G allele protective against asthma) was correlated with decreased expression of GSDMB in BEC and BAL (P = 1.3 9 10\`A4 and 0.04) but not ORMDL3. rs992969 in the promoter region of IL33 (A allele associated with higher eosinophil counts and risk for asthma) was correlated with increased expression of IL33 in BEC (P = 1.3 9 10\`A6) but not in BAL. Conclusions: Our study illustrates cell-type-specific regulation of the expression of asthma-related genes documenting SNPs in TSLP, GSDMB, IL33, HLA-DQB1, C11orf30, DEXI, CDHR3, and ZBTB10 affect asthma risk through cis-regulation of its gene expression. Whenever possible, disease-relevant tissues should be used for transcription analysis. SNPs in TSLP may affect asthma risk through up-regulating TSLP mRNA expression or protein secretion. Further functional studies are warranted.},

Bayesian methods quantify uncertainty through posterior and predictive distributions, but it is difficult to rapidly estimate summaries of these distributions, such as quantiles and intervals. Variational Bayes approximations are widely used, but may badly underestimate posterior covariance. Typically, the focus of Bayesian inference is on point and interval estimates for one-dimensional functionals of interest. In small scale problems, Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms remain the gold standard, but such algorithms face major problems in scaling up to big data. Various modifications have been proposed based on parallelization and approximations based on subsamples, but such approaches are either highly complex or lack theoretical support and/or good performance outside of narrow settings. We propose a very simple and general posterior interval estimation algorithm, which is based on running Markov chain Monte Carlo in parallel for subsets of the data and averaging quantiles estimated from each subset. We provide strong theoretical guarantees and illustrate performance in several applications.},

  abstract = {Background: Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) profiling has revealed remarkable variation in transcription, suggesting that expression of many genes at the single-cell level is intrinsically stochastic and noisy. Yet, on the cell population level, a subset of genes traditionally referred to as housekeeping genes (HKGs) are found to be stably expressed in different cell and tissue types. It is therefore critical to question whether stably expressed genes (SEGs) can be identified on the single-cell level, and if so, how can their expression stability be assessed? We have previously proposed a computational framework for ranking expression stability of genes in single cells for scRNA-seq data normalization and integration. In this study, we perform detailed evaluation and characterization of SEGs derived from this framework. Results: Here, we show that gene expression stability indices derived from the early human and mouse development scRNA-seq datasets and the ''Mouse Atlas'' dataset are reproducible and conserved across species. We demonstrate that SEGs identified from single cells based on their stability indices are considerably more stable than HKGs defined previously from cell populations across diverse biological systems. Our analyses indicate that SEGs are inherently more stable at the single-cell level and their characteristics reminiscent of HKGs, suggesting their potential role in sustaining essential functions in individual cells. Conclusions: SEGs identified in this study have immediate utility both for understanding variation and stability of single-cell transcriptomes and for practical applications such as scRNA-seq data normalization. Our framework for calculating gene stability index, ''scSEGIndex,'' is incorporated into the scMerge Bioconductor R package (https://sydneybiox.github.io/scMerge/reference/scSEGIndex.html) and can be used for identifying genes with stable expression in scRNA-seq datasets.},

  abstract = {Background: Large quantities of digital images are now generated for biological collections, including those developed in projects premised on the high-throughput screening of genome-phenome experiments. These images often carry annotations on taxonomy and observable features, such as anatomical structures and phenotype variations often recorded in response to the environmental factors under which the organisms were sampled. At present, most of these annotations are described in free text, may involve limited use of non-standard vocabularies, and rarely specify precise coordinates of features on the image plane such that a computer vision algorithm could identify, extract and annotate them. Therefore, researchers and curators need a tool that can identify and demarcate features in an image plane and allow their annotation with semantically contextual ontology terms. Such a tool would generate data useful for inter and intra-specific comparison and encourage the integration of curation standards. In the future, quality annotated image segments may provide training data sets for developing machine learning applications for automated image annotation. Results: We developed a novel image segmentation and annotation software application, ``Annotation of Image Segments with Ontologies'' (AISO). The tool enables researchers and curators to delineate portions of an image into multiple highlighted segments and annotate them with an ontology-based controlled vocabulary. AISO is a freely available Java-based desktop application and runs on multiple platforms. It can be downloaded at http://www. plantontology.org/software/AISO. Conclusions: AISO enables curators and researchers to annotate digital images with ontology terms in a manner which ensures the future computational value of the annotated images. We foresee uses for such data-encoded image annotations in biological data mining, machine learning, predictive annotation, semantic inference, and comparative analyses.},

Our method circumvents the well-known miscalibration issue with explicit confidence reports as well as the specification of the cost-function required by `opt-out' or post-decision wagering methods. We show that observers' inferred confidence in their first decision and its use in a subsequent decision (conditioned upon the correctness of the first) fall short of both the ideal Bayesian strategy, as well as of an under-sampling approximation or a modified Bayesian strategy augmented with an additional bias term to accommodate global miscalibration of confidence. The observed data are instead significantly better fitted by a model positing that observers use only few confidence levels or states, at odds with the continuous confidence function of stimulus level prescribed by a normative behavior. These findings question the validity of normative-Bayesian accounts of subjective confidence and metaperceptual judgments.},

We find sex-biased regulatory network structures in each tissue. Even though most transcription factors (TFs) are not differentially expressed between males and females, many have sex-biased regulatory targeting patterns. In each tissue, genes that are differentially targeted by TFs between the sexes are enriched for tissue-related functions and diseases. In brain tissue, for example, genes associated with Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease are targeted by different sets of TFs in each sex. Our systems-based analysis identifies a repertoire of TFs that play important roles in sex-specific architecture of gene regulatory networks, and it underlines sex-specific regulatory processes in both health and disease.},

We show that the log-transformation can introduce systematic errors when cells vary in sequencing coverage, leading to spurious non-zero differences in expression and artificial population structure in simulations. We observe similar effects in real scRNA-seq data where the difference in transformed values between groups of cells is not an accurate proxy for the log-fold change. We provide some practical recommendations to overcome this effect and analytically derive an expression for a larger pseudo-count that controls the transformation-induced error to a specified threshold.},

In multilevel analysis, the major restriction is often the higher-level sample size. In this paper, a simulation study is used to determine the influence of different sample sizes at the group level on the accuracy of the estimates (regression coefficients and variances) and their standard errors. In addition, the influence of other factors, such as the lowest-level sample size and different variance distributions between the levels (different intraclass correlations), is examined. The results show that only a small sample size at level two (meaning a sample of 50 or less) leads to biased estimates of the second-level standard errors. In all of the other simulated conditions the estimates of the regression coefficients, the variance components, and the standard errors are unbiased and accurate.},

  abstract = {Gene expression analysis has become a ubiquitous tool for studying a wide range of human diseases. In a typical analysis we compare distinct phenotypic groups and attempt to identify genes that are, on average, significantly different between them. Here we describe an innovative approach to the analysis of gene expression data, one that identifies differences in expression variance between groups as an informative metric of the group phenotype. We find that genes with different expression variance profiles are not randomly distributed across cell signaling networks. Genes with low-expression variance, or higher constraint, are significantly more connected to other network members and tend to function as core members of signal transduction pathways. Genes with higher expression variance have fewer network connections and also tend to sit on the periphery of the cell. Using neural stem cells derived from patients suffering from Schizophrenia (SZ), Parkinson's disease (PD), and a healthy control group, we find marked differences in expression variance in cell signaling pathways that shed new light on potential mechanisms associated with these diverse neurological disorders. In particular, we find that expression variance of core networks in the SZ patient group was considerably constrained, while in contrast the PD patient group demonstrated much greater variance than expected. One hypothesis is that diminished variance in SZ patients corresponds to an increased degree of constraint in these pathways and a corresponding reduction in robustness of the stem cell networks. These results underscore the role that variation plays in biological systems and suggest that analysis of expression variance is far more important in disease than previously recognized. Furthermore, modeling patterns of variability in gene expression could fundamentally alter the way in which we think about how cellular networks are affected by disease processes.},

  abstract = {Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a flexible and scalable framework for non-linear dimensionality reduction. However, in application domains such as genomics where data sets are typically tabular and highdimensional, a black-box approach to dimensionality reduction does not provide sufficient insights. Common data analysis workflows additionally use clustering techniques to identify groups of similar features. This usually leads to a two-stage process, however, it would be desirable to construct a joint modelling framework for simultaneous dimensionality reduction and clustering of features. In this paper, we propose to achieve this through the BasisVAE : a combination of the VAE and a probabilistic clustering prior, which lets us learn a one-hot basis function representation as part of the decoder network. Furthermore, for scenarios where not all features are aligned, we develop an extension to handle translationinvariant basis functions. We show how a collapsed variational inference scheme leads to scalable and efficient inference for BasisVAE, demonstrated on various toy examples as well as on single-cell gene expression data.},

  abstract = {Background: Human immunity relies on the coordinated responses of many cellular subsets and functional states. Inter-individual variations in cellular composition and communication could thus potentially alter host protection. Here, we explore this hypothesis by applying single-cell RNA-sequencing to examine viral responses among the dendritic cells (DCs) of three elite controllers (ECs) of HIV-1 infection. Results: To overcome the potentially confounding effects of donor-to-donor variability, we present a generally applicable computational framework for identifying reproducible patterns in gene expression across donors who share a unifying classification. Applying it, we discover a highly functional antiviral DC state in ECs whose fractional abundance after in vitro exposure to HIV-1 correlates with higher CD4+ T cell counts and lower HIV-1 viral loads, and that effectively primes polyfunctional T cell responses in vitro. By integrating information from existing genomic databases into our reproducibility-based analysis, we identify and validate select immunomodulators that increase the fractional abundance of this state in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells from healthy individuals in vitro. Conclusions: Overall, our results demonstrate how single-cell approaches can reveal previously unappreciated, yet important, immune behaviors and empower rational frameworks for modulating systems-level immune responses that may prove therapeutically and prophylactically useful.},

On average, {$<$}1 coding base substitution/tumor is lost through negative selection, with purifying selection almost absent outside homozygous loss of essential genes.

On average, tumors carry \$4 coding substitutions under positive selection, ranging from {$<$}1/tumor in thyroid and testicular cancers to {$>$}10/tumor in endometrial and colorectal cancers. Half of driver substitutions occur in yet-to-be-discovered cancer genes. With increasing mutation burden, numbers of driver mutations increase, but not linearly. We systematically catalog cancer genes and show that genes vary extensively in what proportion of mutations are drivers versus passengers.},

Brain CT images showing cerebrovascular accidents were presented to 12 neurologists and 12 control subjects. The subjects' ocular fixation positions were recorded using an eye-tracking device (Eyelink 1000). Heat maps were created based on the eyefixation patterns of each group and compared between the two groups. The heat maps revealed that the areas on which control subjects frequently fixated often coincided with areas identified as outstanding in saliency maps, while the areas on which neurologists frequently fixated often did not. Dwell time in regions of interest (ROI) was likewise compared between the two groups, revealing that, although dwell time on large lesions was not different between the two groups, dwell time in clinically important areas with low salience was longer in neurologists than in controls. Therefore it appears that neurologists intentionally scan clinically important areas when reading brain CT images showing cerebrovascular accidents. Both neurologists and control subjects used the ``bottom-up salience'' form of visual attention, although the neurologists more effectively used the ``top-down instruction'' form.},

Two distinct cerebral networks exerted top-down control: distractor suppression engaged the left intraparietal sulcus, while target enhancement involved the frontal eye field and lateral occipital cortex. Hence, attentional selection is implemented in integrated maps in visual cortex, which provide precise topographic information about target--distractor locations thus allowing for successful visual search.},

For this purpose, we are taking the first step to interpret the recorded actions of world-class expert pathologists on a set of digitized breast biopsy images. We propose an algorithm to extract regions of interest from the logs of image screenings using zoom levels, time and the magnitude of panning motion. Using diagnostically relevant regions marked by experts, we use the visual bag-of-words model with texture and color features to describe these regions and train probabilistic classifiers to predict similar regions of interest in new whole slide images. The proposed algorithm gives promising results for detecting diagnostically relevant regions. We hope this attempt to predict the regions that attract pathologists' attention will provide the first step in a more comprehensive study to understand the diagnostic patterns in histopathology.},

Existing differential expression (DE) analysis methods cannot distinguish these two types of zeros. We developed an R package DEsingle which employed Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial model to estimate the proportion of real and dropout zeros and to define and detect 3 types of DE genes in singlecell RNA-seq data with higher accuracy.},

It has been well documented and studied in the ecological literature but has received little attention in the fisheries literature. Avoiding pseudoreplication in analyses of fisheries data can be difficult due to the complexity of the statistical procedures required. However, recent developments in statistical methodology are decreasing the extent to which pseudoreplication has to be tolerated. Seven examples are given here, beginning with simple design-based remedies and progressing to more challenging examples including the model-based remedies of mixed-effects modelling, generalized linear mixed models, state-space models, and geostatistics.},

However, even a small violation of this assumption can have a large impact on the outcome of a Bayesian procedure. We introduce a novel approach to Bayesian inference that improves robustness to small departures from the model: rather than conditioning on the event that the observed data are generated by the model, one conditions on the event that the model generates data close to the observed data, in a distributional sense. When closeness is defined in terms of relative entropy, the resulting ``coarsened'' posterior can be approximated by simply tempering the likelihood\textemdash that is, by raising the likelihood to a fractional power\textemdash thus, inference can usually be implemented via standard algorithms, and one can even obtain analytical solutions when using conjugate priors. Some theoretical properties are derived, and we illustrate the approach with real and simulated data using mixture models, autoregressive models of unknown order, and variable selection in linear regression.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a new deterministic approximation technique in Bayesian networks. This method, ``Expectation Propagation,'' unifies two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Loopy belief propagation, because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for a limited class of belief networks, such as those which are purely discrete. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states by only retaining expectations, such as mean and variance, and iterates until these expectations are consistent throughout the network. This makes it applicable to hybrid networks with discrete and continuous nodes. Experiments with Gaussian mixture models show Expectation Propagation to be convincingly better than methods with similar computational cost: Laplace's method, variational Bayes, and Monte Carlo. Expectation Propagation also provides an efficient algorithm for training Bayes point machine classifiers.},

However, Bayesian learning methods in distributed computing environments are often problem- or distributionspecific and use ad hoc techniques. We propose a novel general approach to Bayesian inference that is scalable and robust to corruption in the data. Our technique is based on the idea of splitting the data into several non-overlapping subgroups, evaluating the posterior distribution given each independent subgroup, and then combining the results. Our main contribution is the proposed aggregation step which is based on finding the geometric median of subset posterior distributions. Presented theoretical and numerical results confirm the advantages of our approach.},

This article surveys the R package pec which provides a set of functions for efficient computation of prediction error curves. The software implements inverse probability of censoring weights to deal with right censored data and several variants of cross-validation to deal with the apparent error problem. In principle, all kinds of prediction models can be assessed, and the package readily supports most traditional regression modeling strategies, like Cox regression or additive hazard regression, as well as state of the art machine learning methods such as random forests, a nonparametric method which provides promising alternatives to traditional strategies in low and highdimensional settings. We show how the functionality of pec can be extended to yet unsupported prediction models. As an example, we implement support for random forest prediction models based on the R packages randomSurvivalForest and party. Using data of the Copenhagen Stroke Study we use pec to compare random forests to a Cox regression model derived from stepwise variable selection.},

The epiblast subsequently undergoes considerable expansion of cell numbers prior to gastrulation. To investigate underlying regulatory principles, we performed systematic single-cell RNA sequencing (seq) of conceptuses from E3.5 to E6.5. The epiblast shows reactivation and subsequent inactivation of the X chromosome, with Zfp57 expression associated with reactivation and inactivation together with other candidate regulators. At E6.5, the transition from epiblast to primitive streak is linked with decreased expression of polycomb subunits, suggesting a key regulatory role. Notably, our analyses suggest elevated transcriptional noise at E3.5 and within the non-committed epiblast at E6.5, coinciding with exit from pluripotency. By contrast, E6.5 primitive streak cells became highly synchronized and exhibit a shortened G1 cellcycle phase, consistent with accelerated proliferation. Our study systematically charts transcriptional noise and uncovers molecular processes associated with early lineage decisions.},

First, we arbitrarily partition data onto multiple machines. Then, on each machine, any classical MCMC method (e.g., Gibbs sampling) may be used to draw samples from a posterior distribution given the data subset. Finally, the samples from each machine are combined to form samples from the full posterior. This embarrassingly parallel algorithm allows each machine to act independently on a subset of the data (without communication) until the final combination stage. We prove that our algorithm generates asymptotically exact samples and empirically demonstrate its ability to parallelize burn-in and sampling in several models.},

Divide-and-conquer strategies, which split the data into batches and, for each batch, run independent MCMC algorithms targeting the corresponding subposterior, can spread the computational burden across a number of separate computer cores. The challenge with such strategies is in recombining the subposteriors to approximate the full posterior. By creating a Gaussian-process approximation for each log-subposterior density we create a tractable approximation for the full posterior. This approximation is exploited through three methodologies: firstly a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm targeting the expectation of the posterior density provides a sample from an approximation to the posterior; secondly, evaluating the true posterior at the sampled points leads to an importance sampler that, asymptotically, targets the true posterior expectations; finally, an alternative importance sampler uses the full Gaussian-process distribution of the approximation to the log-posterior density to re-weight any initial sample and provide both an estimate of the posterior expectation and a measure of the uncertainty in it.},

Methods based on fully parametric mixture models are available, but lack of fit in some examples indicates that more flexible models may be beneficial. Existing, more flexible, mixture models work at the level of one-dimensional gene-specific summary statistics, and so when there are relatively few measurements per gene these methods may not provide sensitive detectors of differential expression. We propose a hierarchical mixture model to provide methodology that is both sensitive in detecting differential expression and sufficiently flexible to account for the complex variability of normalized microarray data. EM-based algorithms are used to fit both parametric and semiparametric versions of the model. We restrict attention to the two-sample comparison problem; an experiment involving Affymetrix microarrays and yeast translation provides the motivating case study. Gene-specific posterior probabilities of differential expression form the basis of statistical inference; they define short gene lists and false discovery rates. Compared to several competing methodologies, the proposed methodology exhibits good operating characteristics in a simulation study, on the analysis of spike-in data, and in a cross-validation calculation.},

In the current study we have used microarray platform to examine fetal sex-specific global changes in placental gene expression in pregnancies complicated by asthma as compared to non-asthmatic subjects. Methods: Placental RNA was extracted from 11 control subjects and 38 asthmatic subjects. Labeled cDNA was hybridized to an oligonucleotide chip with 1700 double spotted well-characterized human genes. Global gene expression data analysis and visualization were performed using the Binary Tree-Structured Vector Quantization (BTSVQ) software. Functional relationships of differentially expressed genes were assessed using proteineprotein interaction database I2D, network analysis and visualization software NAViGaTOR and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software. Results: Overall, 65 genes were found to be altered in placentae of pregnancies complicated by asthma. Of these, only 6 genes were altered in male placentae. There were 59 gene changes in female placentae of asthmatic mothers relative to control placentae. Some of the sex-specific genes were associated with growth, inflammation and immune pathways. Conclusion: There are sex-specific alterations in placental gene expression in the presence of maternal asthma. Given that many of the identified genes in the female placentae were associated with or involved in cellular growth and tissue development, these may contribute to the sexually dimorphic difference in fetal growth in response to maternal asthma.},

As yet, a rigorous analysis methodology has not been developed and we are still in the stages of exploring the features of the data. Results: We investigated the effect of transcript length bias in RNA-seq data using three different published data sets. For standard analyses using aggregated tag counts for each gene, the ability to call differentially expressed genes between samples is strongly associated with the length of the transcript. Conclusion: Transcript length bias for calling differentially expressed genes is a general feature of current protocols for RNA-seq technology. This has implications for the ranking of differentially expressed genes, and in particular may introduce bias in gene set testing for pathway analysis and other multi-gene systems biology analyses.},

Recently, several developments in RNA-seq methods have provided an even more complete characterization of RNA transcripts. These developments include improvements in transcription start site mapping, strand-specific measurements, gene fusion detection, small RNA characterization and detection of alternative splicing events. Ongoing developments promise further advances in the application of RNA-seq, particularly direct RNA sequencing and approaches that allow RNA quantification from very small amounts of cellular materials.},

Some findings show poor precise estimates for the variance components. On the other hand, discrete response multilevel models have been investigated less widely. In this paper we analyze the influence of different factors on the accuracy of estimates and standard errors of estimates in a binary response 2-level model, through a Monte Carlo simulation study. We investigate the hypothesis of: (a) small sample sizes; (b) different intraclass correlation coefficients; (c) different numbers of quadrature points in the estimation procedure. Standard errors of estimates are studied through a noncoverage indicator. In all instances we have considered, the point estimates are unbiased (even with very small sample sizes), while the variance components are underestimated. The accuracy of the standard errors of variance estimates needs a very large number of groups.},

Roughly speaking, they measure the minimal effort required to reconfigure the probability mass of one distribution in order to recover the other distribution. They are ubiquitous in mathematics, with a long history that has seen them catalyze core developments in analysis, optimization, and probability. Beyond their intrinsic mathematical richness, they possess attractive features that make them a versatile tool for the statistician: They can be used to derive weak convergence and convergence of moments, and can be easily bounded; they are well-adapted to quantify a natural notion of perturbation of a probability distribution; and they seamlessly incorporate the geometry of the domain of the distributions in question, thus being useful for contrasting complex objects. Consequently, they frequently appear in the development of statistical theory and inferential methodology, and they have recently become an object of inference in themselves. In this review, we provide a snapshot of the main concepts involved in Wasserstein distances and optimal transportation, and a succinct overview of some of their many statistical aspects.},

Navigation of digitized slides is interactive and intended to simulate viewing glass slides with a microscope (virtual microscopy). Image viewing software permits users to edit, annotate, analyze, and easily share whole slide images (WSI). As a result, WSI have begun to replace the traditional light microscope, offering a myriad of opportunities for education. This article focuses on current applications of WSI in education and proficiency testing.WSI has been successfully explored for graduate education (medical, dental, and veterinary schools), training of pathology residents, as an educational tool in allied pathology schools (e.g., cytotechnology), for virtual tracking and tutoring, tele-education (tele-conferencing), e-learning, virtual workshops, at tumor boards, with interactive publications, and on examinations. WSI supports flexible and cost-effective distant learning and augments problem-oriented teaching, competency evaluation, and proficiency testing. WSI viewed on touchscreen displays and with tablet technology are especially beneficial for education. Further investigation is necessary to develop superior WSI applications that better support education and to design viewing stations with ergonomic tools that improve the WSI-human interface and navigation of virtual slides. Studies to determine the impact of training pathologists without exposure to actual glass slides are also needed.},

This novel technique helps us to understand gene regulation as well as gene by gene interactions more systematically. In the microarray experiment, however, many undesirable systematic variations are observed. Even in replicated experiment, some variations are commonly observed. Normalization is the process of removing some sources of variation which affect the measured gene expression levels. Although a number of normalization methods have been proposed, it has been difficult to decide which methods perform best. Normalization plays an important role in the earlier stage of microarray data analysis. The subsequent analysis results are highly dependent on normalization. Results: In this paper, we use the variability among the replicated slides to compare performance of normalization methods. We also compare normalization methods with regard to bias and mean square error using simulated data. Conclusions: Our results show that intensity-dependent normalization often performs better than global normalization methods, and that linear and nonlinear normalization methods perform similarly. These conclusions are based on analysis of 36 cDNA microarrays of 3,840 genes obtained in an experiment to search for changes in gene expression profiles during neuronal differentiation of cortical stem cells. Simulation studies confirm our findings.},

To overcome these limitations, we develop Causal Multivariate Mediation within Extended Linkage disequilibrium (CaMMEL), a novel Bayesian inference framework to jointly model multiple mediated and unmediated effects relying only on summary statistics. We show in simulation that CaMMEL accurately distinguishes between mediating and pleiotropic genes unlike existing methods. We applied CaMMEL to Alzheimer's disease (AD) and found 206 causal genes in sub-threshold loci (p {$<$} 10-4). We prioritized 21 genes which mediate at least 5\% of local genetic variance, disrupting innate immune pathways in AD.},

Human eye movements were recorded while participants viewed a series of digitized images of complex natural and artificial scenes. Stimulus dependence of attention, as measured by the correlation between computed stimulus salience and fixation locations, was found to be significantly greater than that expected by chance alone and furthermore was greatest for eye movements that immediately follow stimulus onset. The ability to guide attention of three modeled stimulus features (color, intensity and orientation) was examined and found to vary with image type. Additionally, the effect of the drop in visual sensitivity as a function of eccentricity on stimulus salience was examined, modeled, and shown to be an important determiner of attentional allocation. Overall, the results indicate that stimulus-driven, bottom-up mechanisms contribute significantly to attentional guidance under natural viewing conditions. \'O 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

In an example application involving 14 cases of pediatric acute megakaryoblastic leukemia, MIST more robustly identified features that perfectly discriminate subjects according to gender or the presence of a prognostically relevant fusion-gene than did seven other OASIS methods in the analysis of RNA-seq exon expression, RNA-seq exon junction expression and micorarray exon expression data. MIST was also effective at identifying features related to gender or molecular subtype in an example application involving 157 adult cases of acute myeloid leukemia.},

We introduce a highly efficient unbiased estimator of the log-likelihood based on control variates, such that the computing cost is much smaller than that of the full log-likelihood in standard MCMC. The likelihood estimate is bias-corrected and used in two dependent pseudo-marginal algorithms to sample from a perturbed posterior, for which we derive the asymptotic error with respect to n and m, respectively. We propose a practical estimator of the error and show that the error is negligible even for a very small m in our applications. We demonstrate that subsampling MCMC is substantially more efficient than standard MCMC in terms of sampling efficiency for a given computational budget, and that it outperforms other subsampling methods for MCMC proposed in the literature.

  abstract = {Practitioners of Bayesian statistics have long depended on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to obtain samples from intractable posterior distributions. Unfortunately, MCMC algorithms are typically serial, and do not scale to the large datasets typical of modern machine learning. The recently proposed consensus Monte Carlo algorithm removes this limitation by partitioning the data and drawing samples conditional on each partition in parallel [22]. A fixed aggregation function then combines these samples, yielding approximate posterior samples. We introduce variational consensus Monte Carlo (VCMC), a variational Bayes algorithm that optimizes over aggregation functions to obtain samples from a distribution that better approximates the target. The resulting objective contains an intractable entropy term; we therefore derive a relaxation of the objective and show that the relaxed problem is blockwise concave under mild conditions. We illustrate the advantages of our algorithm on three inference tasks from the literature, demonstrating both the superior quality of the posterior approximation and the moderate overhead of the optimization step. Our algorithm achieves a relative error reduction (measured against serial MCMC) of up to 39\% compared to consensus Monte Carlo on the task of estimating 300-dimensional probit regression parameter expectations; similarly, it achieves an error reduction of 92\% on the task of estimating cluster comembership probabilities in a Gaussian mixture model with 8 components in 8 dimensions. Furthermore, these gains come at moderate cost compared to the runtime of serial MCMC\textemdash achieving near-ideal speedup in some instances.},

  abstract = {Aims: To create and evaluate a virtual reality (VR) microscope that is as efficient as the conventional microscope, seeking to support the introduction of digital slides into routine practice. Methods and results: A VR microscope was designed and implemented by combining ultra-high-resolution displays with VR technology, techniques for fast interaction, and high usability. It was evaluated using a mixed factorial experimental design with technology and task as within-participant variables and grade of histopathologist as a between-participant variable. Time to diagnosis was similar for the conventional and VR microscopes. However, there was a significant difference in the mean magnification used between the two technologies, with participants working at a higher level of magnification on the VR microscope. Conclusions: The results suggest that, with the right technology, efficient use of digital pathology for routine practice is a realistic possibility. Further work is required to explore what magnification is required on the VR microscope for histopathologists to identify diagnostic features, and the effect on this of the digital slide production process.},

  abstract = {Variational inference has become a widely used method to approximate posteriors in complex latent variables models. However, deriving a variational inference algorithm generally requires significant model-specific analysis, and these efforts can hinder and deter us from quickly developing and exploring a variety of models for a problem at hand. In this paper, we present a ``black box'' variational inference algorithm, one that can be quickly applied to many models with little additional derivation. Our method is based on a stochastic optimization of the variational objective where the noisy gradient is computed from Monte Carlo samples from the variational distribution. We develop a number of methods to reduce the variance of the gradient, always maintaining the criterion that we want to avoid difficult model-based derivations. We evaluate our method against the corresponding black box sampling based methods. We find that our method reaches better predictive likelihoods much faster than sampling methods. Finally, we demonstrate that Black Box Variational Inference lets us easily explore a wide space of models by quickly constructing and evaluating several models of longitudinal healthcare data.},

  abstract = {Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a genetically, epigenetically, and clinically heterogeneous disease. Despite this heterogeneity, the Bruton tyrosine kinase (BTK) inhibitor ibrutinib provides effective treatment for the vast majority of CLL patients. To define the underlining regulatory program, we analyzed high-resolution time courses of ibrutinib treatment in closely monitored patients, combining cellular phenotyping (flow cytometry), single-cell transcriptome profiling (scRNA-seq), and chromatin mapping (ATAC-seq). We identified a consistent regulatory program shared across all patients, which was further validated by an independent CLL cohort. In CLL cells, this program starts with a sharp decrease of NF-{$\kappa$}B binding, followed by reduced regulatory activity of lineage-defining transcription factors (including PAX5 and IRF4) and erosion of CLL cell identity, finally leading to the acquisition of a quiescence-like gene signature which was shared across several immune cell types. Nevertheless, we observed patient-to-patient variation in the speed of its execution, which we exploited to predict patient-specific dynamics in the response to ibrutinib based on pre-treatment samples. In aggregate, our study describes the cellular, molecular, and regulatory effects of therapeutic B cell receptor inhibition in CLL at high temporal resolution, and it establishes a broadly applicable method for epigenome/transcriptome-based treatment monitoring.},

  abstract = {Acute airway acidification is a potent stimulus of sensory nerves and occurs commonly with gastroesophageal reflux disease, cystic fibrosis, and asthma. In infants and adults, airway acidification can acutely precipitate asthma-like symptoms, and treatment-resistant asthma can be associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease. Airway protective behaviors, such as mucus secretion and airway smooth muscle contraction, are often exaggerated in asthma. These behaviors are manifested through activation of neural circuits. In some populations, the neural response to acid might be particularly important. For example, the immune response in infants is relatively immature compared with adults. Infants also have a high frequency of gastroesophageal reflux. Thus, in the current study, we compared the transcriptomes of an airway-nervous system circuit (e.g., tracheal epithelia, nodose ganglia, and brain stem) in neonatal piglets challenged with intra-airway acid. We hypothesized that the identification of parallel changes in the transcriptomes of two neutrally connected tissues might reveal the circuit response, and, hence, molecules important for the manifestation of asthma-like features. Intra-airway acid induced airway hyperreactivity and airway obstruction in male piglets. In contrast, female piglets displayed airway obstruction without airway hyperreactivity. Pairwise comparisons revealed parallel changes in genes directly implicated in airway hyperreactivity ( scn10a) in male acid-challenged piglets, whereas acid-challenged females exhibited parallel changes in genes associated with mild asthma ( stat 1 and isg15). These findings reveal sex-specific responses to acute airway acidification and highlight distinct molecules within a neural circuit that might be critical for the manifestation of asthma-like symptoms in pediatric populations.},

This tool allows useful exploration of images, composed of thousands of microscopical fields of view at different levels of magnification, emulating an actual microscopical examination. The aim of this study was to establish the main pathologist's navigation patterns when exploring virtual microscopy slides, using a graphical user interface, adapted to the pathologist's workflow. Four pathologists with a similar level of experience, graduated from the same pathology program, navigated six virtual slides. Different issues were evaluated, namely, the percentage of common visited image regions, the time spent at each and its coincidence level, that is to say, the region of interest location. In addition, navigation patterns were also assessed, i.e., mouse movement velocities and linearity of the diagnostic paths. Results suggest that regions of interest are determined by a complex combination of the visited area, the time spent at each visit and the coincidence level among pathologists. Additionally, linear trajectories and particular velocity patterns were found for the registered diagnostic paths.},

An overdispersed Poisson model is used to account for both biological and technical variability. Empirical Bayes methods are used to moderate the degree of overdispersion across transcripts, improving the reliability of inference. The methodology can be used even with the most minimal levels of replication, provided at least one phenotype or experimental condition is replicated. The software may have other applications beyond sequencing data, such as proteome peptide count data.},

In order to improve reproducibility and standardization of the results interpretation, IHC quantification methods have been developed. IHC interpretation based in whole slide imaging or virtual microscopy is of special interest. The objective of this work is to review the different computerbased programs for automatic immunohistochemistry and Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) evaluation. Scanning solutions and image analysis software in immunohistochemistry were studied, focusing especially on systems based in virtual slides. Integrated scanning and image analysis systems are available (Bacus TMAScore, Dako ACIS III, Genetix Ariol, Aperio Image Analysis, 3DHistech Mirax HistoQuant, Bioimagene Pathiam). Other image analysis software systems (Definiens TissueMap, SlidePath Tissue Image Analysis) can be applied to several virtual slide formats. Fluorescence is the preferred approach in HistoRx AQUA, since it allows for a better compartmentalization of signals. Multispectral imaging using CRi Nuance allows multiple antibodies immunohistochemistry, and different stain unmixing. Most current popular automated image analysis solutions are aimed to brightfield immunohistochemistry, but fluorescence and FISH solutions may become more important in the near future. Automated quantitative tissue microarrays (TMA) analysis is essential to provide high-throughput analysis. Medical informatics standards in images (DICOM) and workflow (IHE) under development will foster the use of image analysis in Pathology Departments.},

The human inspector performing visual inspection of an aircraft is the backbone of this process and training is an effective strategy for improving their inspection performance. Previous studies have shown offline feedback training to be effective in improving subsequent visual inspection performance. Because experienced inspectors are known to adopt a better inspection strategy than novices, providing visualization of experts' cognitive processes a priori can accelerate novices' adoption of the experts' strategy. Using eye tracking equipment, we record the point of regard of an expert inspector performing an inspection task in a virtual reality simulator. Analysis of their eye movements leads to a visualization of their scanpaths and allows us to display the inspector's visual search (hence cognitive) strategy. We show how providing this type of scanpath-based feedforward training of novices leads to improved accuracy performance in the simulator coupled with an observed speed-accuracy tradeoff. We contend that the tradeoff results from trained novices adopting a slower paced strategy through increased fixation durations, suggesting trained novices learn a more deliberate target search/discrimination strategy that requires more time to execute.},

However, algorithms for performing fixation identification are often described informally and rarely compared in a meaningful way. In this paper we propose a taxonomy of fixation identification algorithms that classifies algorithms in terms of how they utilize spatial and temporal information in eye-tracking protocols. Using this taxonomy, we describe five algorithms that are representative of different classes in the taxonomy and are based on commonly employed techniques. We then evaluate and compare these algorithms with respect to a number of qualitative characteristics. The results of these comparisons offer interesting implications for the use of the various algorithms in future work.},

With IRB approval, two-view (cranio-caudal and mediolateral oblique views) DBTs of human subject breasts were obtained with a GE GEN2 prototype DBT system that acquires 21 projection angles spanning 60\textdegree{} in 3\textdegree{} increments. A data set of 307\,volumes (154 human subjects) was divided by case into independent training (127 with MCs) and test sets (104 with MCs and 76 free of MCs). A simultaneous algebraic reconstruction technique with multiscale bilateral filtering (MSBF) regularization was used to enhance microcalcifications and suppress noise. During the MSBF regularized reconstruction, the DBT volume was separated into high frequency (HF) and low frequency components representing microcalcifications and larger structures. At the final iteration, maximum intensity projection was applied to the regularized HF volume to generate a PPJ image that contained MCs with increased contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) and reduced search space. High CNR objects in the PPJ image were extracted and labeled as microcalcification candidates. Convolution neural network trained to recognize the image pattern of microcalcifications was used to classify the candidates into true calcifications and tissue structures and artifacts. The remaining microcalcification candidates were grouped into MCs by dynamic conditional clustering based on adaptive CNR threshold and radial distance criteria. False positive (FP) clusters were further reduced using the number of candidates in a cluster, CNR and size of microcalcification candidates. At 85\% sensitivity an FP rate of 0.71 and 0.54 was achieved for view- and case-based sensitivity, respectively, compared to 2.16 and 0.85 achieved in DBT. The improvement was significant (p-value = 0.003) by JAFROC analysis.},

  abstract = {Quantification of gene expression levels at the single cell level has revealed that gene expression can vary substantially even across a population of homogeneous cells. However, it is currently unclear what genomic features control variation in gene expression levels, and whether common genetic variants may impact gene expression variation. Here, we take a genome-wide approach to identify expression variance quantitative trait loci (vQTLs). To this end, we generated single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from 53 Yoruba individuals. We collected data for a median of 95 cells per individual and a total of 5,447 single cells, and identified 235 mean expression QTLs (eQTLs) at 10\% FDR, of which 79\% replicate in bulk RNA-seq data from the same individuals. We further identified 5 vQTLs at 10\% FDR, but demonstrate that these can also be explained as effects on mean expression. Our study suggests that dispersion QTLs (dQTLs) which could alter the variance of expression independently of the mean can have larger fold changes, but explain less phenotypic variance than eQTLs. We estimate 4,015 individuals as a lower bound to achieve 80\% power to detect the strongest dQTLs in iPSCs. These results will guide the design of future studies on understanding the genetic control of gene expression variance.},

The high proportion of zero counts in a typical scRNA-seq data matrix has garnered particular attention, and lead to widespread but inconsistent use of terminology such as ``dropout'' and ``missing data.'' Here, we argue that much of this terminology is unhelpful and confusing, and outline simple ways of thinking about models for scRNA-seq data that can help avoid this confusion. The key ideas are: (1) observed scRNA-seq counts reflect both the actual expression level of each gene in each cell and the measurement process, and it is important for models to explicitly distinguish contributions from these two distinct factors; and (2) the measurement process can be adequately described by a simple Poisson model, a claim for which we provide both theoretical and empirical support. We show how these ideas lead to a simple, flexible statistical framework which encompasses a number of commonly used models and analysis methods, and how this framework makes explicit their different assumptions and helps interpret their results. We also illustrate how explicitly separating models for expression and measurement can help address questions of biological interest, such as whether mRNA expression levels are multi-modal among cells.},

Additionally, several genes with laterally differential expression in the ovaries seem to determine female gonads for growth or regression, whereas right-left differences in testes are mostly limited to the differentially expressed genes present in both sexes. With a few exceptions, side-specific genes are not located on the sex chromosomes.},

Single cell RNA-seq is revolutionizing transcriptomics and is enabling interindividual differential gene expression analysis and identification of genetic variants associated with gene expression, so called expression quantitative trait loci at cell-type resolution. Current methods for power analysis and guidance of experimental design either do not account for the specific characteristics of single cell data or are not suitable to model interindividual comparisons. Results: Here we present a statistical framework for experimental design and power analysis of single cell differential gene expression between groups of individuals and expression quantitative trait locus analysis. The model relates sample size, number of cells per individual and sequencing depth to the power of detecting differentially expressed genes within individual cell types. Power analysis is based on data driven priors from literature or pilot experiments across a wide range of application scenarios and single cell RNA-seq platforms. Using these priors we show that, for a fixed budget, the number of cells per individual is the major determinant of power. Conclusion: Our model is general and allows for systematic comparison of alternative experimental designs and can thus be used to guide experimental design to optimize power. For a wide range of applications, shallow sequencing of high numbers of cells per individual leads to higher overall power than deep sequencing of fewer cells. The model is implemented as an R package scPower.},

Social scientists are regularly using multilevel models to analyse the data generated by such surveys, investigating variation across both space and time. We show, however, that such models are usually specified erroneously. They typically omit one or more relevant random effects, thereby ignoring important clustering in the data, which leads to downward biases in the standard errors. These biases occur even if the fixed effects are specified correctly; if the fixed effects are incorrect, erroneous specification of the random effects worsens biases in the coefficients. We illustrate these problems using Monte Carlo simulations and two empirical examples. Our recommendation to researchers fitting multilevel models to comparative longitudinal survey data is to include random effects at all potentially relevant levels, thereby avoiding any mismatch between the random and fixed parts of their models.},

Graphics processing units can alleviate the processor bottleneck, but memory or disk bottlenecks can only be eliminated by splitting data across multiple machines. Communication between large numbers of machines is expensive (regardless of the amount of data being communicated), so there is a need for algorithms that perform distributed approximate Bayesian analyses with minimal communication. Consensus Monte Carlo operates by running a separate Monte Carlo algorithm on each machine, and then averaging individual Monte Carlo draws across machines. Depending on the model, the resulting draws can be nearly indistinguishable from the draws that would have been obtained by running a single machine algorithm for a very long time. Examples of consensus Monte Carlo are shown for simple models where single-machine solutions are available, for large single-layer hierarchical models, and for Bayesian additive regression trees (BART).},

Traditionally, transcriptomic data have been analyzed from bulk samples, masking the heterogeneity now seen across individual cells. Even within the same cellular population, genes can be highly expressed in some cells but not expressed (or lowly expressed) in others. Therefore, the computational approaches used to analyze bulk RNA sequencing data are not appropriate for the analysis of scRNA-seq data. Here, we present a novel statistical model for high dimensional and zero-inflated scRNA-seq count data to identify differentially expressed (DE) genes across cell types. Correlated random effects are employed based on an initial clustering of cells to capture the cell-to-cell variability within treatment groups. Moreover, this model is flexible and can be easily adapted to an independent random effect structure if needed. We apply our proposed methodology to both simulated and real data and compare results to other popular methods designed for detecting DE genes. Due to the hurdle model's ability to detect differences in the proportion of cells expressed and the average expression level (among the expressed cells), our methods naturally identify some genes as DE that other methods do not, and we demonstrate with real data that these uniquely detected genes are associated with similar biological processes and functions.},

For example, single-cell genomics will help to uncover cell lineage relationships; single-cell transcriptomics will supplant the coarse notion of marker-based cell types; and single-cell epigenomics and proteomics will allow the functional states of individual cells to be analysed. These technologies will become integrated within a decade or so, enabling high-throughput, multi-dimensional analyses of individual cells that will produce detailed knowledge of the cell lineage trees of higher organisms, including humans. Such studies will have important implications for both basic biological research and medicine.},

In the Uwano study, eye movements are used to characterize the performance of individuals in reviewing source code. Their analysis showed that subjects who did not spend enough time initially scanning the code tend to take more time finding defects. The study here follows a similar setup with added eyetracking measures and analyses on effectiveness and efficiency of finding defects with respect to eye gaze. The subject pool is larger and is comprised of a varied skill level. Results indicate that scanning significantly correlates with defect detection time as well as visual effort on relevant defect lines. Results of the study are compared and contrasted to the Uwano study.},

We exploit the natural nested structure inherent to many model components, which defines the model component to be a flexible extension of a base model. Proper priors are defined to penalise the complexity induced by deviating from the simpler base model and are formulated after the input of a user-defined scaling parameter for that model component, both in the univariate and the multivariate case. These priors are invariant to reparameterisations, have a natural connection to Jeffreys' priors, are designed to support Occam's razor and seem to have excellent robustness properties, all which are highly desirable and allow us to use this approach to define default prior distributions. Through examples and theoretical results, we demonstrate the appropriateness of this approach and how it can be applied in various situations.},

Print-tip loess normalization provides a well-tested general purpose normalization method which has given good results on a wide range of arrays. The method may be refined by using quality weights for individual spots. The method is best combined with diagnostic plots of the data which display the spatial and intensity trends. When diagnostic plots show that biases still remain in the data after normalization, further normalization steps such as plate-order normalization or scalenormalization between the arrays may be undertaken. Composite normalization may be used when control spots are available which are known to be not differentially expressed. Variations on loess normalization include global loess normalization and 2D normalization. Detailed commands are given to implement the normalization techniques using freely available software.},

For massive data, it is necessary to store and process subsets on different machines in a distributed manner. We propose a simple, general, and highly efficient approach, which first runs a posterior sampling algorithm in parallel on different machines for subsets of a large data set. To combine these subset posteriors, we calculate the Wasserstein barycenter via a highly efficient linear program. The resulting estimate for the Wasserstein posterior (WASP) has an atomic form, facilitating straightforward estimation of posterior summaries of functionals of interest. The WASP approach allows posterior sampling algorithms for smaller data sets to be trivially scaled to huge data. We provide theoretical justification in terms of posterior consistency and algorithm efficiency. Examples are provided in complex settings including Gaussian process regression and nonparametric Bayes mixture models.},

These methods divide the data into smaller subsets, sample from the posterior distribution of parameters in parallel on all the subsets, and combine posterior samples from all the subsets to approximate the full data posterior distribution. The smaller size of any subset compared to the full data implies that posterior sampling on any subset is computationally more efficient than sampling from the true posterior distribution. Since the combination step takes negligible time relative to sampling, posterior computations can be scaled to massive data by dividing the full data into sufficiently large number of data subsets. One such approach relies on the geometry of posterior distributions estimated across different subsets and combines them through their barycenter in a Wasserstein space of probability measures. We provide theoretical guarantees on the accuracy of approximation that are valid in many applications. We show that the geometric method approximates the full data posterior distribution better than its competitors across diverse simulations and reproduces known results when applied to a movie ratings database.},

  abstract = {Background: Differences in gene expression drive phenotypic differences between species, yet major organs and tissues generally have conserved gene expression programs. Several comparative transcriptomic studies have observed greater similarity in gene expression between homologous tissues from different vertebrate species than between diverse tissues of the same species. However, a recent study by Lin and colleagues reached the opposite conclusion. These studies differed in the species and tissues analyzed, and in technical details of library preparation, sequencing, read mapping, normalization, gene sets, and clustering methods. Results: To better understand gene expression evolution we reanalyzed data from four studies, including that of Lin, encompassing 6\textendash 13 tissues each from 11 vertebrate species using standardized mapping, normalization, and clustering methods. An analysis of independent data showed that the set of tissues chosen by Lin et al. were more similar to each other than those analyzed by previous studies. Comparing expression in five common tissues from the four studies, we observed that samples clustered exclusively by tissue rather than by species or study, supporting conservation of organ physiology in mammals. Furthermore, inter-study distances between homologous tissues were generally less than intra-study distances among different tissues, enabling informative meta-analyses. Notably, when comparing expression divergence of tissues over time to expression variation across 51 human GTEx tissues, we could accurately predict the clustering of expression for arbitrary pairs of tissues and species. Conclusions: These results provide a framework for the design of future evolutionary studies of gene expression and demonstrate the utility of comparing RNA-seq data across studies.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS\textemdash{} In Tai's Model, the total area under a curve is computed by dividing the area under the curve between two designated values on the X-axis (abscissas) into small segments (rectangles and triangles) whose areas can be accurately calculated from their respective geometrical formulas. The total sum of these individual areas thus represents the total area under the curve. Validity of the model is established by comparing total areas obtained from this model to these same areas obtained from graphic method Gess than {$\pm$}0.4\%). Other formulas widely applied by researchers under- or overestimated total area under a metabolic curve by a great margin. RESULTS \textemdash{} Tai's model proves to be able to 1) determine total area under a curve with precision; 2) calculate area with varied shapes that may or may not intercept on one or both X/Y axes; 3) estimate total area under a curve plotted against varied time intervals (abscissas), whereas other formulas only allow the same time interval; and 4) compare total areas of metabolic curves produced by different studies. CONCLUSIONS \textemdash{} The Tai model allows flexibility in experimental conditions, which means, in the case of the glucose-response curve, samples can be taken with differing time intervals and total area under the curve can still be determined with precision.},

Proper modeling of multivariate taxon counts is essential to the power of detecting this association. Existing models are limited in handling excessive zero observations in taxon counts and in flexibly accommodating complex correlation structures and dispersion patterns among taxa. In this article, we develop a new probability distribution, zero-inflated generalized Dirichlet multinomial (ZIGDM), that overcomes these limitations in modeling multivariate taxon counts. Based on this distribution, we propose a ZIGDM regression model to link microbial abundances to covariates (e.g. disease status) and develop a fast expectation\textendash maximization algorithm to efficiently estimate parameters in the model. The derived tests enable us to reveal rich patterns of variation in microbial compositions including differential mean and dispersion. The advantages of the proposed methods are demonstrated through simulation studies and an analysis of a gut microbiome dataset.},

To answer this question we recorded eye movements while observers viewed natural scenes, and recorded image characteristics centred at the locations that observers fixated. To investigate potential differences in the visual characteristics of fixated versus non-fixated locations, these images were transformed to make intensity, contrast, colour, and edge content explicit. Signal detection and information theoretic techniques were then used to compare fixated regions to those that were not. The presence of contrast and edge information was more strongly discriminatory than luminance or chromaticity. Fixated locations tended to be more distinctive in the high spatial frequencies. Extremes of low frequency luminance information were avoided. With prolonged viewing, consistency in fixation locations between observers decreased. In contrast to [Parkhurst, D. J., Law, K., \& Niebur, E. (2002). Modeling the role of salience in the allocation of overt visual attention. Vision Research, 42 (1), 107\textendash 123] we found no change in the involvement of image features over time. We attribute this difference in our results to a systematic bias in their metric.

Moreover, costs associated with processing these growing datasets will become prohibitive without improving the computational efficiency and scalability of methods. Here, we show that recently developed machine-learning libraries (TensorFlow and PyTorch) facilitate implementation of genomics methods for GPUs and significantly accelerate computations. To demonstrate this, we re-implemented methods for two commonly performed computational genomics tasks: QTL mapping and Bayesian non-negative matrix factorization. Our implementations ran {$>$} 200 times faster than current CPU-based versions, and these analyses are {$\sim$}5-10 fold cheaper on GPUs due to the vastly shorter runtimes. We anticipate that the accessibility of these libraries, and the improvements in run-time will lead to a transition to GPU-based implementations for a wide range of computational genomics methods.},

  abstract = {Background: While the majority of the health messages on cigarette packages contain threatening health information, previous studies indicate that risk information can trigger defensive reactions, especially when the information is self-relevant (i.e., smokers). Providing coping information, information that provides help for quitting smoking, might increase attention to health messages instead of triggering defensive reactions. Methods: Eye-movement registration can detect attention preferences for different health education messages over a longer period of time during message exposure. In a randomized, experimental study with 23 smoking and 41 non-smoking student volunteers, eye-movements were recorded for sixteen self-created cigarette packages containing health texts that presented either high risk or coping information combined with a high threat or a low threat smoking-related photo. Results: Results of the eye movement data showed that smokers tend to spend more time looking (i.e., more unique fixations and longer dwell time) at the coping information than at the high risk information irrespective of the content of the smoking-related photo. Non-smokers tend to spend more time looking at the high risk information than at the coping information when the information was presented in combination with a high threat smoking photo. When a low threat photo was presented, non-smokers paid more attention to the coping information than to the high risk information. Results for the smoking photos showed more attention allocation for low threat photos that were presented in combination with high risk information than for low threat photos in combination with coping information. No attention differences were found for the high threat photos. Conclusions: Non-smokers demonstrated an attention preference for high risk information as opposed to coping information, but only when text information was presented in combination with a high threat photo. For smokers, however, our findings suggest more attention allocation for coping information than for health risk information. This preference for coping information is not reflected in current health messages to motivate smokers to quit smoking. Coping information should be more frequently implemented in health message design to increase attention for these messages and thus contribute to effective persuasion.},

Altogether we generated 10 datasets using a combination of droplet and plate-based scRNA-seq protocols, with varying data quality, population heterogeneity and noise levels. Using these benchmark datasets, we compared different protocols, evaluated the spike-in standard and multiple data analysis methods for tasks ranging from normalization and imputation, to clustering, trajectory analysis and data integration. Evaluation of methods across multiple datasets revealed some that performed well in general and others that suited specific situations. Our dataset and analysis provide a comprehensive comparison framework for benchmarking most popular scRNA-seq analysis tasks.},

The maximum of the computational saliency value over the target support area correlates most strongly with visual conspicuity for 12 of the 13 models. A simple multiscale contrast model and the MCC metric both yield the largest correlation with human visual target conspicuity ({$>$}0:84). Local image saliency largely determines human visual inspection and interpretation of static and dynamic scenes. Computational saliency models therefore have a wide range of important applications, like adaptive content delivery, region-of-interest-based image compression, video summarization, progressive image transmission, image segmentation, image quality assessment, object recognition, and contentaware image scaling. However, current bottom-up saliency models do not incorporate important visual effects like crowding and lateral interaction. Additional knowledge about the exact nature of the interactions between the mechanisms mediating human visual saliency is required to develop these models further. The MCC metric and its associated psychophysical saliency measurement procedure are useful tools to systematically investigate the relative contribution of different feature dimensions to overall visual target saliency.},

In this paper, we propose to use a multiple instance learning (MIL) method in an application for the detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In our work, local intensity patches are extracted as features. However, not all the patches extracted from patients with dementia are equally affected by the disease and some of them may not be characteristic of morphology associated with the disease. Therefore, there is some ambiguity in assigning disease labels to these patches. The problem of the ambiguous training labels can be addressed by weakly supervised learning techniques such as MIL. A graph is built for each image to exploit the relationships among the patches and then to solve the MIL problem. The constructed graphs contain information about the appearances of patches and the relationships among them, which can reflect the inherent structures of images and aids the classification. Using the baseline MR images of 834 subjects from the ADNI study, the proposed method can achieve a classification accuracy of 89\% between AD patients and healthy controls, and 70\% between patients defined as stable MCI and progressive MCI in a leave-one-out cross validation. Compared with two state-of-the-art methods using the same dataset, the proposed method can achieve similar or improved results, providing an alternative framework for the detection and prediction of neurodegenerative diseases.},

Results By pooling the data from all readers, machine learning produced highly accurate predictive models linking image content, gaze, and cognition. Potential linking of those with diagnostic error was also supported to some extent. Merging readers' gaze metrics and cognitive opinions with computer-extracted image features identified 59\% of the readers' diagnostic errors while confirming 97.3\% of their correct diagnoses. The readers' individual perceptual and cognitive behaviors could be adequately predicted by modeling the behavior of others. However, personalized tuning was in many cases beneficial for capturing more accurately individual behavior. Conclusions There is clearly an interaction between radiologists' gaze, diagnostic decision, and image content which can be modeled with machine learning algorithms.},

  abstract = {Single cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) has become the most widely used high-throughput technology for gene expression profiling of individual cells. The potential of being able to measure cell-to-cell variability at a high-dimensional genomic scale opens numerous new lines of investigation in basic and clinical research. For example, by identifying groups of cells with expression profiles unlike those observed in cells with known phenotypes, new cell types may be discovered. Dimension reduction followed by unsupervised clustering are the quantitative approaches typically used to facilitate such discoveries. However, a challenge for this approach is that most scRNA-Seq datasets are sparse, with the percentages of measurements reported as zero ranging from 35\% to 99\% across cells, and these zeros are partially explained by experimental inefficiencies that lead to censored data. Furthermore, the observed across-cell differences in the percentages of zeros are partly due to technical artifacts rather than biological differences. Unfortunately, standard dimension reduction approaches treat these censored values as true zeros, which leads to the identification of distorted low-dimensional factors. When these factors are used for clustering, the distortion leads to incorrect identification of biological groups. Here, we propose an approach that accounts for cell-specific censoring with a varying-censoring aware matrix factorization (VAMF) model that permits the identification of factors in the presence of the above described systematic bias. We demonstrate the advantages of our approach on published scRNA-Seq data and confirm these on simulated data.},

They also assume that all heterogeneity between individuals can be modelled through covariates.

This can be interpreted as the introduction of a random effect in the survival distribution. We introduce the family of Shape Mixtures of Log-Normal distributions, which covers a wide range of density and hazard functions. Bayesian inference under non-subjective priors based on the Jeffreys rule is examined and conditions for posterior propriety are established. The existence of the posterior distribution on the basis of a sample of point observations is not always guaranteed and a solution through set observations is implemented. In addition, a method for outlier detection based on the mixture structure is proposed. A simulation study illustrates the performance of our methods under different scenarios and an application to a real dataset is provided. Supplementary materials, which include R code, are available online.},

LOO and WAIC have various advantages over simpler estimates of predictive error such as AIC and DIC but are less used in practice because they involve additional computational steps. Here we lay out fast and stable computations for LOO and WAIC that can be performed using existing simulation draws. We introduce an efficient computation of LOO using Pareto-smoothed importance sampling (PSIS), a new procedure for regularizing importance weights. Although WAIC is asymptotically equal to LOO, we demonstrate that PSIS-LOO is more robust in the finite case with weak priors or influential observations. As a byproduct of our calculations, we also obtain approximate standard errors for estimated predictive errors and for comparison of predictive errors between two models. We implement the computations in an R package called loo and demonstrate using models fit with the Bayesian inference package Stan.},

A self-report survey and eye-tracking session were completed by 102 youth (mean age{$\frac{1}{4}$}11.6 years; 56.4\% were white; 43.1\% were female) between April and November 2010. Participants viewed 40 food/beverage advertisements on a computer and their eye movements were recorded. Objective attention measures included total viewing time, fixation length (time spent viewing characters/logos, unhealthy food/beverage items), and fixation count (number of times an individual stops to examine characters/logos, unhealthy food/beverage items). Food/ beverage preferences and choices were measured by self-report. The preferences index summed responses to 12 questions measuring snack food and sugar-sweetened beverage preferences and the choices index summed responses to eight questions measuring consumption of snack foods and sugar-sweetened beverages. Regression models examined whether attention to food/beverage advertising was associated with food preferences and choices, controlling for sex, age, and body mass index z score. The length of time and number of times participants looked at unhealthy food and beverage items within advertisements were each significantly associated with unhealthy food/ beverage preferences of youth (P{$<$}0.05). Associations were no longer significant after controlling for demographic characteristics. Attention to advertising was not significantly associated with food/beverage choices. Research with larger samples is needed to more fully understand the role of attention. Future research should also examine the association between attention to advertising and purchase requests, given the important role of parents in the decision-making process surrounding food choice.},

The plasmid library construction is the first critical step in shotgun sequencing. If the DNA libraries are not uniform in size, nonchimeric, and do not randomly represent the genome, then the subsequent steps cannot accurately reconstruct the genome sequence. We used automated high-throughput DNA sequencing and the computational infrastructure to enable efficient tracking of enormous amounts of sequence information (27.3 million sequence reads; 14.9 billion bp of sequence). Sequencing and tracking from both ends of plasmid clones from 2-, 10-, and 50-kbp libraries were essential to the computational reconstruction of the genome. Our evidence indicates that the accurate pairing rate of end sequences was greater than 98\%.},

  abstract = {Quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression models have equal numbers of parameters, and either could be used for overdispersed count data. While they often give similar results, there can be striking differences in estimating the effects of covariates. We explain when and why such differences occur. The variance of a quasi-Poisson model is a linear function of the mean while the variance of a negative binomial model is a quadratic function of the mean. These variance relationships affect the weights in the iteratively weighted least-squares algorithm of fitting models to data. Because the variance is a function of the mean, large and small counts get weighted differently in quasi-Poisson and negative binomial regression. We provide an example using harbor seal counts from aerial surveys. These counts are affected by date, time of day, and time relative to low tide. We present results on a data set that showed a dramatic difference on estimating abundance of harbor seals when using quasiPoisson vs. negative binomial regression. This difference is described and explained in light of the different weighting used in each regression method. A general understanding of weighting can help ecologists choose between these two methods.},

A promising approach to solve this problem is embarrassingly parallel MCMC (EP-MCMC), which first partitions the data into multiple subsets and runs independent sampling algorithms on each subset. The subset posterior draws are then aggregated via some combining rules to obtain the final approximation. Existing EP-MCMC algorithms are limited by approximation accuracy and difficulty in resampling. In this article, we propose a new EP-MCMC algorithm PART that solves these problems.

Here we present a new experimental approach MeSMLR-seq (methyltransferase treatment followed by single-molecule long-read sequencing) for long-range mapping of nucleosomes and chromatin accessibility at single DNA molecules, and thus achieve comprehensive-coverage characterization of the corresponding heterogeneity. We applied MeSMLR-seq to haploid yeast, where single DNA molecules represent single cells, and thus we could investigate the combinatorics of many (up to 356) nucleosomes at long range in single cells. We illustrated the differential organization principles of nucleosomes surrounding transcription start site for silently- and actively-transcribed genes, at the single-cell level and in the long-range scale. The heterogeneous patterns of chromatin statuses spanning multiple genes were phased. Together with single-cell RNA-seq data, we quantitatively revealed how chromatin accessibility correlated with gene transcription positively in a highly-heterogeneous scenario. Moreover, we quantified the openness of promoters and investigated the coupled chromatin changes of adjacent genes at single DNA molecules during transcription reprogramming.},

  abstract = {Background: The analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data plays an important role in understanding the intrinsic and extrinsic cellular processes in biological and biomedical research. One significant effort in this area is the detection of differentially expressed (DE) genes. scRNAseq data, however, are highly heterogeneous and have a large number of zero counts, which introduces challenges in detecting DE genes. Addressing these challenges requires employing new approaches beyond the conventional ones, which are based on a nonzero difference in average expression. Several methods have been developed for differential gene expression analysis of scRNAseq data. To provide guidance on choosing an appropriate tool or developing a new one, it is necessary to evaluate and compare the performance of differential gene expression analysis methods for scRNAseq data. Results: In this study, we conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the performance of eleven differential gene expression analysis software tools, which are designed for scRNAseq data or can be applied to them. We used simulated and real data to evaluate the accuracy and precision of detection. Using simulated data, we investigated the effect of sample size on the detection accuracy of the tools. Using real data, we examined the agreement among the tools in identifying DE genes, the run time of the tools, and the biological relevance of the detected DE genes. Conclusions: In general, agreement among the tools in calling DE genes is not high. There is a trade-off between true-positive rates and the precision of calling DE genes. Methods with higher true positive rates tend to show low precision due to their introducing false positives, whereas methods with high precision show low true positive rates due to identifying few DE genes. We observed that current methods designed for scRNAseq data do not tend to show better performance compared to methods designed for bulk RNAseq data. Data multimodality and abundance of zero read counts are the main characteristics of scRNAseq data, which play important roles in the performance of differential gene expression analysis methods and need to be considered in terms of the development of new methods.},

Here, we demonstrate DNA microscopy, a distinct imaging modality for scalable, optics-free mapping of relative biomolecule positions. In DNA microscopy of transcripts, transcript molecules are tagged in situ with randomized nucleotides, labeling each molecule uniquely. A second in situ reaction then amplifies the tagged molecules, concatenates the resulting copies, and adds new randomized nucleotides to uniquely label each concatenation event. An algorithm decodes molecular proximities from these concatenated sequences and infers physical images of the original transcripts at cellular resolution with precise sequence information. Because its imaging power derives entirely from diffusive molecular dynamics, DNA microscopy constitutes a chemically encoded microscopy system.},

We review applications of a variety of empirical Bayes methods to several well-known model-based prediction methods, including penalized regression, linear discriminant analysis, and Bayesian models with sparse or dense priors. We discuss ``formal'' empirical Bayes methods that maximize the marginal likelihood but also more informal approaches based on other data summaries. We contrast empirical Bayes to cross-validation and full Bayes and discuss hybrid approaches. To study the relation between the quality of an empirical Bayes estimator and p, the number of variables, we consider a simple empirical Bayes estimator in a linear model setting. We argue that empirical Bayes is particularly useful when the prior contains multiple parameters, which model a priori information on variables termed ``co-data''. In particular, we present two novel examples that allow for co-data: first, a Bayesian spike-and-slab setting that facilitates inclusion of multiple co-data sources and types and, second, a hybrid empirical Bayes\textendash full Bayes ridge regression approach for estimation of the posterior predictive interval.},

  abstract = {The sampling distributions are generally unavailable in exact form and are approximated either in terms of the asymptotic distributions, or their correction using expansions such as Edgeworth, Laguerre or Cornish\textendash Fisher; or by using transformations analogous to that of Wilson and Hilferty. However, when theoretical routes are intractable, in this electronic age, the sampling distributions can be reasonably approximated using empirical methods. The point is illustrated using the null distribution of Hoeffding's test of bivariate independence which is important because of its consistency against all dependence alternatives. For constructing the approximations we employ two Weibull extensions, the generalized Weibull and the exponentiated Weibull families, which contain a rich variety of density shapes and tail lengths, and have their distribution functions and quantile functions available in closed form, making them convenient for obtaining the necessary percentiles and p-values. Both approximations are seen to be excellent in terms of accuracy, but that based on the generalized Weibull is more portable.},

Transparency is necessary for confirmation and validation, and multiple examiners aid in extracting maximal value from large data sets. Accordingly, database submission and provision of the Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME)3 are required by most journals as a prerequisite for review or acceptance. METHODS: In this study, the level of data submission and MIAME compliance was reviewed for 127 articles that included microarray-based microRNA (miRNA) profiling and were published from July 2011 through April 2012 in the journals that published the largest number of such articles\textemdash PLOS ONE, the Journal of Biological Chemistry, Blood, and Oncogene\textemdash along with articles from 9 other journals, including Clinical Chemistry, that published smaller numbers of array-based articles. RESULTS: Overall, data submission was reported at publication for Ͻ40\% of all articles, and almost 75\% of articles were MIAME noncompliant. On average, articles that included full data submission scored significantly higher on a quality metric than articles with limited or no data submission, and studies with adequate description of methods disproportionately included larger numbers of experimental repeats. Finally, for several articles that were not MIAME compliant, data reanalysis revealed less than complete support for the published conclusions, in 1 case leading to retraction. CONCLUSIONS: These findings buttress the hypothesis that reluctance to share data is associated with low study quality and suggest that most miRNA array investigations are underpowered and/or potentially compromised by a lack of appropriate reporting and data submission.},

Similar to the Dirichlet distribution, the generalized Dirichlet distribution will be shown to conjugate to multinominal sampling.

The abundance of spatial expression data in recent years has led to the modeling and analysis of regulatory networks. The inherent complexity of such data makes it a challenge to extract biological information. We developed staNMF, a method that combines a scalable implementation of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with a new stability-driven model selection criterion. When applied to a set of               Drosophila               early embryonic spatial gene expression images, one of the largest datasets of its kind, staNMF identified 21 principal patterns (PP). Providing a compact yet biologically interpretable representation of               Drosophila               expression patterns, PP are comparable to a fate map generated experimentally by laser ablation and show exceptional promise as a data-driven alternative to manual annotations. Our analysis mapped genes to cell-fate programs and assigned putative biological roles to uncharacterized genes. Finally, we used the PP to generate local transcription factor regulatory networks. Spatially local correlation networks were constructed for six PP that span along the embryonic anterior\textendash posterior axis. Using a two-tail 5\% cutoff on correlation, we reproduced 10 of the 11 links in the well-studied gap gene network. The performance of PP with the               Drosophila               data suggests that staNMF provides informative decompositions and constitutes a useful computational lens through which to extract biological insight from complex and often noisy gene expression data.},

Visualizing these datasets is crucial to biological interpretation, and a popular method is t-stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), which visualizes local patterns well but distorts global structure, such as distances between clusters. We developed similarity weighted nonnegative embedding (SWNE), which enhances interpretation of datasets by embedding the genes and factors that separate cell states on the visualization alongside the cells and maintains fidelity when visualizing local and global structure for both developmental trajectories and discrete cell types. SWNE uses nonnegative matrix factorization to decompose the gene expression matrix into biologically relevant factors; embeds the cells, genes, and factors in a 2D visualization; and uses a similarity matrix to smooth the embeddings. We demonstrate SWNE on single-cell RNA-seq data from hematopoietic progenitors and human brain cells. SWNE is available as an R package at github.com/yanwu2014/swne.},

Zero-inflated Poisson regression models are useful for analyzing such data, but parameter estimates may be seriously biased if the nonzero observations are over-dispersed and simultaneously correlated due to the sampling design or the data collection procedure. In this paper, a zero-inflated negative binomial mixed regression model is presented to analyze a set of pancreas disorder length of stay (LOS) data that comprised mainly same-day separations. Random effects are introduced to account for inter-hospital variations and the dependency of clustered LOS observations. Parameter estimation is achieved by maximizing an appropriate log-likelihood function using an EM algorithm. Alternative modeling strategies, namely the finite mixture of Poisson distributions and the non-parametric maximum likelihood approach, are also considered. The determination of pertinent covariates would assist hospital administrators and clinicians to manage LOS and expenditures efficiently.},

Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) allows the detection of gene expression in each cell. With scRNA-seq, highly variable gene (HVG) discovery allows the detection of genes that contribute strongly to cell-to-cell variation within a homogeneous cell population, such as a population of embryonic stem cells. This analysis is implemented in many software packages. In this study, we compare seven HVG methods from six software packages, including BASiCS, Brennecke, scLVM, scran, scVEGs and Seurat.

Mechanisms of immune escape in this context are unknown. METHODS We analyzed biopsy samples from paired baseline and relapsing lesions in four patients with metastatic melanoma who had had an initial objective tumor regression in response to anti\textendash PD-1 therapy (pembrolizumab) followed by disease progression months to years later. RESULTS Whole-exome sequencing detected clonal selection and outgrowth of the acquired resistant tumors and, in two of the four patients, revealed resistance-associated lossof-function mutations in the genes encoding interferon-receptor\textendash associated Janus kinase 1 (JAK1) or Janus kinase 2 (JAK2), concurrent with deletion of the wild-type allele. A truncating mutation in the gene encoding the antigen-presenting protein beta-2-microglobulin (B2M) was identified in a third patient. JAK1 and JAK2 truncating mutations resulted in a lack of response to interferon gamma, including insensitivity to its antiproliferative effects on cancer cells. The B2M truncating mutation led to loss of surface expression of major histocompatibility complex class I.

  abstract = {Data with multivariate count responses frequently occur in modern applications. The commonly used multinomial-logit model is limiting due to its restrictive mean-variance structure. For instance, analyzing count data from the recent RNA-seq technology by the multinomial-logit model leads to serious errors in hypothesis testing. The ubiquity of overdispersion and complicated correlation structures among multivariate counts calls for more flexible regression models. In this article, we study some generalized linear models that incorporate various correlation structures among the counts. Current literature lacks a treatment of these models, partly because they do not belong to the natural exponential family. We study the estimation, testing, and variable selection for these models in a unifying framework. The regression models are compared on both synthetic and real RNA-seq data. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

  abstract = {Abstract           The benefit of integrating batches of genomic data to increase statistical power in differential expression is often hindered by batch effects, or unwanted variation in data caused by differences in technical factors across batches. It is therefore critical to effectively address batch effects in genomic data. Many existing methods for batch effect adjustment assume continuous, bell-shaped Gaussian distributions for data. However in RNA-Seq studies where data are skewed, over-dispersed counts, this assumption is not appropriate and may lead to erroneous results. Negative binomial regression models have been used to better capture the properties of counts. We developed a batch correction method, ComBat-Seq, using negative binomial regression. ComBat-Seq retains the integer nature of count data in RNA-Seq studies, making the batch adjusted data compatible with common differential expression software packages that require integer counts. We show in realistic simulations that the ComBat-Seq adjusted data result in better statistical power and control of false positives in differential expression, compared to data adjusted by the other available methods. We further demonstrated in a real data example where ComBat-Seq successfully removes batch effects and recovers the biological signal in the data.},

They are also involved in the induction of autoimmune and allergic diseases. Upon T-cell receptor (TCR)-mediated cell activation, naive CD4+ T cells can differentiate into at least four major lineages, Th1, Th2, Th17, and iTreg cells, that participate in different types of immune responses. Networks of cytokines and transcription factors are critical for determining CD4+ T-cell fates and effector cytokine production. Here, we review collaboration and cross-regulation between various essential cytokines in the activation {$\fracslash$} induction of key transcription factors during the process of Th cell differentiation towards these distinct lineages. We also discuss the interactions of key transcription factors at both genetic and protein levels and the function of the resulting network(s) in regulating the expression of effector cytokines.},

We generated data from 583 mouse embryonic stem cells to evaluate six prominent scRNA-seq methods: CEL-seq2, Drop-seq, MARS-seq, SCRBseq, Smart-seq, and Smart-seq2. While Smart-seq2 detected the most genes per cell and across cells, CEL-seq2, Drop-seq, MARS-seq, and SCRB-seq quantified mRNA levels with less amplification noise due to the use of unique molecular identifiers (UMIs). Power simulations at different sequencing depths showed that Drop-seq is more cost-efficient for transcriptome quantification of large numbers of cells, while MARS-seq, SCRB-seq, and Smart-seq2 are more efficient when analyzing fewer cells. Our quantitative comparison offers the basis for an informed choice among six prominent scRNA-seq methods, and it provides a framework for benchmarking further improvements of scRNA-seq protocols.},

Once expressed, CD69 acts as a costimulatory molecule for T cell activation and proliferation. In addition to mature T cells, CD69 is inducibly expressed by immature thymocytes, B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, monocytes, neutrophils and eosinophils, and is constitutively expressed by mature thymocytes and platelets. Recently, cDNA clones encoding human and mouse CD69 were isolated and showed CD69 to be a member of the C-type lectin superfamily. Gene mapping studies have placed CD69 on distal mouse chromosome 6 and human chromosome 1 2 \textasciitilde{} 1 3c,lose to, if not in, the NK gene complex. The structure, chromosomal localization, expression and function of CD69 suggest that it is likely a pleiotropic immune regulator, potentially important not only in NK cell function but also in the activation and differentiation of a wide variety of hematopoietic cells.},

Empirically, we show this dependence across a range of cell types. Thus, single-cell data have a hierarchical structure that current single-cell methods do not address and subsequently the application of such tools leads to biased inference and reduced robustness and reproducibility. When properly simulating the hierarchical structure of single-cell data, commonly applied single-cell differential expression analysis tools exhibit highly inflated type I error rates, particularly when applied together with a batch effect correction for individual as a means of accounting for within sample correlation. As single-cell experiments increase in size and frequency, we propose applying generalized linear mixed models that include random effects for differences among persons to properly account for the correlation structure that exists among measures from cells within an individual.},

  abstract = {Background: Advances in single cell genomics provide a way of routinely generating transcriptomics data at the single cell level. A frequent requirement of single cell expression analysis is the identification of novel patterns of heterogeneity across single cells that might explain complex cellular states or tissue composition. To date, classical statistical analysis tools have being routinely applied, but there is considerable scope for the development of novel statistical approaches that are better adapted to the challenges of inferring cellular hierarchies. Results: We have developed a novel agglomerative clustering method that we call pcaReduce to generate a cell state hierarchy where each cluster branch is associated with a principal component of variation that can be used to differentiate two cell states. Using two real single cell datasets, we compared our approach to other commonly used statistical techniques, such as K-means and hierarchical clustering. We found that pcaReduce was able to give more consistent clustering structures when compared to broad and detailed cell type labels. Conclusions: Our novel integration of principal components analysis and hierarchical clustering establishes a connection between the representation of the expression data and the number of cell types that can be discovered. In doing so we found that pcaReduce performs better than either technique in isolation in terms of characterising putative cell states. Our methodology is complimentary to other single cell clustering techniques and adds to a growing palette of single cell bioinformatics tools for profiling heterogeneous cell populations.},
