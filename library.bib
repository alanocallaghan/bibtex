abstract = {The functional significance of changes in nuclear structure and organization in transformed cells remains one of the most enigmatic questions in cancer biology. In this review, we discuss relationships between nuclear organization and transcription in terms of the three-dimensional arrangement of genes in the interphase cancer nucleus and the regulatory functions of nuclear matrix proteins. We also analyse the role of nuclear topology in the generation of gene fusions. We speculate that this type of multi-layered analysis will one day provide a framework for a more comprehensive understanding of the genetic origins of cancer and the identification of new therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {The urinary proteome is the focus of many studies due to the ease of urine collection and the relative proteome stability. Systems biology allows the combination of multiple omics studies, forming a link between proteomics, metabolomics, genomics and transcriptomics. In-depth data interpretation is achieved by bioinformatics analysis of -omics data sets. It is expected that the contribution of systems biology to the study of the urinary proteome will offer novel insights. The main focus of this review is on technical aspects of proteomics studies, available tools for systems biology analysis and the application of urinary proteomics in clinical studies and systems biology.},

@article{Chen2017,
abstract = {With the routine collection of massive-dimensional predictors in many application areas, screening methods that rapidly identify a small subset of promising predictors have become commonplace. We propose a new MOdular Bayes Screening (MOBS) approach, which involves several novel characteristics that can potentially lead to improved performance. MOBS first applies a Bayesian mixture model to the marginal distribution of the response, obtaining posterior samples of mixture weights, cluster-specific parameters, and cluster allocations for each subject. Hypothesis tests are then introduced, corresponding to whether or not to include a given predictor, with posterior probabilities for each hypothesis available analytically conditionally on unknowns sampled in the first stage and tuning parameters controlling borrowing of information across tests. By marginalizing over the first stage posterior samples, we avoid under-estimation of uncertainty typical of two-stage methods. We greatly simplify the model specification and reduce computational complexity by using {\{}$\backslash$em modularization{\}}. We provide basic theoretical support for this approach, and illustrate excellent performance relative to competitors in simulation studies and the ability to capture complex shifts beyond simple differences in means. The method is illustrated with applications to genomics by using a very high-dimensional cis-eQTL dataset with roughly 38 million SNPs.},

The need for reliable assessment of transcript abundance in biological samples has driven scientists to develop novel technologies such as DNA microarray and RNA-Seq to meet this demand. This review focuses on comparing the two most useful methods for whole transcriptome gene expression profiling. Microarrays are reliable and more cost effective than RNA-Seq for gene expression profiling in model organisms. RNA-Seq will eventually be used more routinely than microarray, but right now the techniques can be complementary to each other. Microarrays will not become obsolete but might be relegated to only a few uses. RNA-Seq clearly has a bright future in bioinformatic data collection.},

abstract = {Rationale and Objectives Use data collected independently at three institutions to compare time to first fixate the true lesion in searching for cancers on mammograms. Examine the fit of the results to a holistic model of visual perception. Materials and Methods The time required to first fixate a cancer on a mammogram was extracted from 400 eye-tracking records collected independently from three institutions. The time was used as an indicator of the initial perception of cancer. The distribution of first fixation times was partitioned into two normally distributed components using mixture distribution analysis. The true-positive fraction of each component was calculated. Results About 57{\%} of the cancers had a 95{\%} chance of being fixated in the first second of viewing. The remainder took longer (range, 1.0 to 15.2 seconds). The true-positive fraction was larger for the lesions hit immediately for most of the readers (TPF = 0.63 vs. 0.52, F = 5.88, P = .02) in 68{\%} (13/19) of the readers. Conclusions The initial detection occurs before visual scanning and, therefore, must be the result of a parallel “global” analysis of the image resulting in an initial holistic, gestalt-like perception. The development of expertise in medical image analysis may consist of a shift in the recognition mechanism from scan-look-detect to look-detect-scan.},

Gene expression has a very dynamic nature; it acts as a bridge between epigenetic marks, DNA sequence and proteins and changes to accommodate the requirements of the cell at each given time. Recent technological advances have created new opportunities to study complex phenotypes from a global point of view. From an animal production perspective, muscle transcriptomics has been investigated in relation to muscle growth, carcass fattening and meat quality traits. In this review, we discuss the impact of nutritional, anatomical and genetic factors on muscle gene expression and meat quality of pigs assessed by microarray technologies. Altogether, several common themes have been revealed by the in-depth analysis of the current body of knowledge, for instance, the involvement of genes related to energy balance and substrate turnover in the oxidative/glycolytic phenotype of red/white muscle fibre types and in the storage of intramuscular fat. The review also covers recent advances in the discovery of expression QTL and regulatory RNAs in porcine breeds as well as technical developments in the field of deep-sequencing technologies that are expected to substantially increase our knowledge about the genetic architecture of meat quality and production traits.},

abstract = {Anticancer drug-associated side effect knowledge often exists in multiple heterogeneous and complementary data sources. A comprehensive anticancer drug-side effect (drug-SE) relationship knowledge base is important for computation-based drug target discovery, drug toxicity predication and drug repositioning. In this study, we present a two-step approach by combining table classification and relationship extraction to extract drug-SE pairs from a large number of high-profile oncological full-text articles. The data consists of 31,255 tables downloaded from the Journal of Oncology (JCO). We first trained a statistical classifier to classify tables into SE-related and -unrelated categories. We then extracted drug-SE pairs from SE-related tables. We compared drug side effect knowledge extracted from JCO tables to that derived from FDA drug labels. Finally, we systematically analyzed relationships between anti-cancer drug-associated side effects and drug-associated gene targets, metabolism genes, and disease indications. The statistical table classifier is effective in classifying tables into SE-related and -unrelated (precision: 0.711; recall: 0.941; F1: 0.810). We extracted a total of 26,918 drug-SE pairs from SE-related tables with a precision of 0.605, a recall of 0.460, and a F1 of 0.520. Drug-SE pairs extracted from JCO tables is largely complementary to those derived from FDA drug labels; as many as 84.7{\%} of the pairs extracted from JCO tables have not been included a side effect database constructed from FDA drug labels. Side effects associated with anticancer drugs positively correlate with drug target genes, drug metabolism genes, and disease indications.},

abstract = {We developed a new computational technique called Step-Level Differential Response (SLDR) to identify genetic regulatory relationships. Our technique takes advantages of functional genomics data for the same species under different perturbation conditions, therefore complementary to current popular computational techniques. It can particularly identify "rare" activation/inhibition relationship events that can be difficult to find in experimental results. In SLDR, we model each candidate target gene as being controlled by N binary-state regulators that lead to ≤2N observable states ("step-levels") for the target. We applied SLDR to the study of the GEO microarray data set GSE25644, which consists of 158 different mutant S. cerevisiae gene expressional profiles. For each target gene t, we first clustered ordered samples into various clusters, each approximating an observable step-level of t to screen out the "de-centric" target. Then, we ordered each gene x as a candidate regulator and aligned t to x for the purpose of examining the step-level correlations between low expression set of x (Ro) and high expression set of x (Rh) from the regulator x to t, by finding max f(t, x): |Ro-Rh| over all candidate × in the genome for each t. We therefore obtained activation and inhibitions events from different combinations of Ro and Rh. Furthermore, we developed criteria for filtering out less-confident regulators, estimated the number of regulators for each target t, and evaluated identified top-ranking regulator-target relationship. Our results can be cross-validated with the Yeast Fitness database. SLDR is also computationally efficient with o(N2) complexity. In summary, we believe SLDR can be applied to the mining of functional genomics big data for future network biology and network medicine applications.},

abstract = {Recent technological advances have improved the whole slide imaging (WSI) scanner quality and reduced the cost of storage, thereby enabling the deployment of digital pathology for routine diagnostics. In this paper we present the experiences from two Swedish sites having deployed routine large-scale WSI for primary review. At Kalmar County Hospital, the digitization process started in 2006 to reduce the time spent at the microscope in order to improve the ergonomics. Since 2008, more than 500,000 glass slides have been scanned in the routine operations of Kalmar and the neighboring Link{\"{o}}ping University Hospital. All glass slides are digitally scanned yet they are also physically delivered to the consulting pathologist who can choose to review the slides on screen, in the microscope, or both. The digital operations include regular remote case reporting by a few hospital pathologists, as well as around 150 cases per week where primary review is outsourced to a private clinic. To investigate how the pathologists choose to use the digital slides, a web-based questionnaire was designed and sent out to the pathologists in Kalmar and Link{\"{o}}ping. The responses showed that almost all pathologists think that ergonomics have improved and that image quality was sufficient for most histopathologic diagnostic work. 38 ± 28{\%} of the cases were diagnosed digitally, but the survey also revealed that the pathologists commonly switch back and forth between digital and conventional microscopy within the same case. The fact that two full-scale digital systems have been implemented and that a large portion of the primary reporting is voluntarily performed digitally shows that large-scale digitization is possible today.},

abstract = {Gaussian scale mixture priors are frequently employed in Bayesian analysis of high-dimensional models, and several members of this family have optimal risk properties when the truth is sparse. While optimization-based algorithms for the extremely popular Lasso and elastic net procedures can scale to dimension in the hundreds of thousands, corresponding Bayesian methods that use Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) for computation are limited to problems at least an order of magnitude smaller. This is due to high computational cost per step of the associated Markov kernel and growth of the variance of time-averaging estimators as a function of dimension. We propose an MCMC algorithm for computation in these models that combines block updating and approximations of the Markov kernel to directly combat both of these factors. Our algorithm gives orders of magnitude speedup over the best existing alternatives in high-dimensional applications. We give theoretical guarantees for the accuracy of the kernel approximation. The scalability of the algorithm is illustrated in simulations with problem size as large as {\$}N=5,000{\$} observations and {\$}p=50,000{\$} predictors, and an application to a genome wide association study with {\$}N=2,267{\$} and {\$}p=98,385{\$}. The empirical results also show that the new algorithm yields estimates with lower mean squared error, intervals with better coverage, and elucidates features of the posterior that were often missed by previous algorithms in high dimensions, including bimodality of posterior marginals indicating uncertainty about which covariates belong in the model. This latter feature is an important motivation for a Bayesian approach to testing and selection in high dimensions.},

abstract = {Despite rapid developments in single cell sequencing technology, sample-specific batch effects, detection of cell doublets, and the cost of generating massive datasets remain outstanding challenges. Here, we introduce cell "hashing", where oligo-tagged antibodies against ubiquitously expressed surface proteins are used to uniquely label cells from distinct samples, which can be subsequently pooled. By sequencing these tags alongside the cellular transcriptome, we can assign each cell to its sample of origin, and robustly identify doublets originating from multiple samples. We demonstrate our approach by pooling eight human PBMC samples on a single run of the 10x Chromium system, substantially reducing our per-cell costs for library generation. Cell "hashing" is inspired by, and complementary to, elegant multiplexing strategies based on genetic variation, which we also leverage to validate our results. We therefore envision that our approach will help to generalize the benefits of single cell multiplexing to diverse samples and experimental designs.},

Previous genome-wide association studies of RCC have identified five variants conferring risk of the disease. Here we report the results from a discovery RCC genome-wide association study and replication analysis, including a total of 2,411 patients and 71,497 controls. One variant, rs35252396[CG] located at 8q24.21, is significantly associated with RCC after combining discovery and replication results (OR=1.27, P(combined)=5.4 × 10(-11)) and has an average risk allele frequency in controls of 46{\%}. rs35252396[CG] does not have any strongly correlated variants in the genome and is located within a region predicted to have regulatory functions in several cell lines, including six originating from the kidney. This is the first RCC variant reported at 8q24.21 and it is largely independent (r(2)≤0.02) of the numerous previously reported cancer risk variants at this locus.},

abstract = {The chromosome 9p21 region has been implicated in the pathogenesis of multiple cancers. We analyzed 9p21 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from eight genome-wide association studies (GWAS) with data deposited in dbGaP, including studies of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), gastric cancer (GC), pancreatic cancer, renal cell carcinoma (RCC), lung cancer (LC), breast cancer (BrC), bladder cancer (BC) and prostate cancer (PrC). The number of subjects ranged from 2252 (PrC) to 7619 (LC). SNP-level analyses for each cancer were conducted by logistic regression or random-effects meta-analysis. A subset-based statistical approach (ASSET) was performed to combine SNP-level P values across multiple cancers. We calculated gene-level P values using the adaptive rank truncated product method. We identified that rs1063192 and rs2157719 in the CDKN2A/2B region were significantly associated with ESCC and rs2764736 (3' of TUSC1) was associated with BC (P ≤ 2.59 × 10(-6)). ASSET analyses identified four SNPs significantly associated with multiple cancers: rs3731239 (CDKN2A intronic) with ESCC, GC and BC (P = 3.96 × 10(-) (4)); rs10811474 (3' of IFNW1) with RCC and BrC (P = 0.001); rs12683422 (LINGO2 intronic) with RCC and BC (P = 5.93 × 10(-) (4)) and rs10511729 (3' of ELAVL2) with LC and BrC (P = 8.63 × 10(-) (4)). At gene level, CDKN2B, CDKN2A and CDKN2B-AS1 were significantly associated with ESCC (P ≤ 4.70 × 10(-) (5)). Rs10511729 and rs10811474 were associated with cis-expression of 9p21 genes in corresponding cancer tissues in the expression quantitative trait loci analysis. In conclusion, we identified several genetic variants in the 9p21 region associated with the risk of multiple cancers, suggesting that this region may contribute to a shared susceptibility across different cancer types.},

abstract = {Machine learning techniques have been widely used to detect morphological abnormalities from structural brain magnetic resonance imaging data and to support the diagnosis of neurological diseases such as dementia. In this paper, we propose to use a multiple instance learning (MIL) method in an application for the detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its prodromal stage mild cognitive impairment (MCI). In our work, local intensity patches are extracted as features. However, not all the patches extracted from patients with dementia are equally affected by the disease and some of them may not be characteristic of morphology associated with the disease. Therefore, there is some ambiguity in assigning disease labels to these patches. The problem of the ambiguous training labels can be addressed by weakly supervised learning techniques such as MIL. A graph is built for each image to exploit the relationships among the patches and then to solve the MIL problem. The constructed graphs contain information about the appearances of patches and the relationships among them, which can reflect the inherent structures of images and aids the classification. Using the baseline MR images of 834 subjects from the ADNI study, the proposed method can achieve a classification accuracy of 89{\%} between AD patients and healthy controls, and 70{\%} between patients defined as stable MCI and progressive MCI in a leave-one-out cross validation. Compared with two state-of-the-art methods using the same dataset, the proposed method can achieve similar or improved results, providing an alternative framework for the detection and prediction of neurodegenerative diseases. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

After very first infusion of a dose 500 times smaller than that found safe in animal studies, all six human volunteers faced life-threatening conditions involving multiorgan failure for which they were moved to intensive care unit. After this particular incident, a lot was changed over how first in man trials are approved by regulatory authorities and the way clinical trials are conducted.

As the cost of sequencing declines, next-generation sequencing (NGS) instruments and datasets will become increasingly accessible to the wider research community. Investigators are understandably eager to harness the power of these new technologies. Sequencing human genomes on these platforms, however, presents numerous production and bioinformatics challenges. Production issues like sample contamination, library chimaeras and variable run quality have become increasingly problematic in the transition from technology development lab to production floor. Analysis of NGS data, too, remains challenging, particularly given the short-read lengths (35-250 bp) and sheer volume of data. The development of streamlined, highly automated pipelines for data analysis is critical for transition from technology adoption to accelerated research and publication. This review aims to describe the state of current NGS technologies, as well as the strategies that enable NGS users to characterize the full spectrum of DNA sequence variation in humans.},

This method was applied to two datasets:
- Immune cell activation: 
splicing, translation, polymerase up-regulated and reduced residual overdispersion
Fasl, PD-L1 and transcription factors up-reg and increased overdispersion


This paper also describes the "horizontal integration" approach usable when technical spike-ins are not available. This uses a measurement error model approach (effectively batch correction?)},

abstract = {An eye-tracking study is presented that investigates how indi- viduals find defects in source code. This work partially repli- cates a previous eye-tracking study by Uwano et al. [2006]. In the Uwano study, eye movements are used to characterize the performance of individuals in reviewing source code. Their analysis showed that subjects who did not spend enough time initially scanning the code tend to take more time finding de- fects. The study here follows a similar setup with added eye- tracking measures and analyses on effectiveness and efficiency of finding defects with respect to eye gaze. The subject pool is larger and is comprised of a varied skill level. Results indicate that scanning significantly correlates with defect detection time as well as visual effort on relevant defect lines. Results of the study are compared and contrasted to the Uwano study.},

abstract = {The promise of Bayesian methods for big data sets has not fully been realized due to the lack of scalable computational algorithms. For massive data, it is necessary to store and process subsets on different machines in a distributed manner. We propose a simple, general, and highly efficient approach, which first runs a posterior sampling algorithm in parallel on different machines for subsets of a large data set. To combine these subset posteriors, we calculate the Wasserstein barycenter via a highly efficient linear program. The resulting estimate for the Wasserstein posterior (WASP) has an atomic form, facilitating straightforward estimation of posterior summaries of functionals of interest. The WASP approach allows posterior sampling algorithms for smaller data sets to be trivially scaled to huge data. We provide theoretical justification in terms of posterior consistency and algorithm efficiency. Examples are provided in complex settings including Gaussian process regression and nonparametric Bayes mixture models.},

abstract = {Every cancer originates from a single cell. During expansion of the neoplastic cell population, individual cells acquire genetic and phenotypic differences from each other. Here, to investigate the nature and extent of intra-tumour diversification, we characterized organoids derived from multiple single cells from three colorectal cancers as well as from adjacent normal intestinal crypts. Colorectal cancer cells showed extensive mutational diversification and carried several times more somatic mutations than normal colorectal cells. Most mutations were acquired during the final dominant clonal expansion of the cancer and resulted from mutational processes that are absent from normal colorectal cells. Intra-tumour diversification of DNA methylation and transcriptome states also occurred; these alterations were cell-autonomous, stable, and followed the phylogenetic tree of each cancer. There were marked differences in responses to anticancer drugs between even closely related cells of the same tumour. The results indicate that colorectal cancer cells experience substantial increases in somatic mutation rate compared to normal colorectal cells, and that genetic diversification of each cancer is accompanied by pervasive, stable and inherited differences in the biological states of individual cancer cells.},

abstract = {The common approach to the multiplicity problem calls for controlling the familywise error rate (FWER). This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses-the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

@article{Fang2012,
abstract = {There has been increased interest in discovering combinations of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are strongly associated with a phenotype even if each SNP has little individual effect. Efficient approaches have been proposed for searching two-locus combinations from genome-wide datasets. However, for high-order combinations, existing methods either adopt a brute-force search which only handles a small number of SNPs (up to few hundreds), or use heuristic search that may miss informative combinations. In addition, existing approaches lack statistical power because of the use of statistics with high degrees-of-freedom and the huge number of hypotheses tested during combinatorial search. Due to these challenges, functional interactions in high-order combinations have not been systematically explored. We leverage discriminative-pattern-mining algorithms from the data-mining community to search for high-order combinations in case-control datasets. The substantially improved efficiency and scalability demonstrated on synthetic and real datasets with several thousands of SNPs allows the study of several important mathematical and statistical properties of SNP combinations with order as high as eleven. We further explore functional interactions in high-order combinations and reveal a general connection between the increase in discriminative power of a combination over its subsets and the functional coherence among the genes comprising the combination, supported by multiple datasets. Finally, we study several significant high-order combinations discovered from a lung-cancer dataset and a kidney-transplant-rejection dataset in detail to provide novel insights on the complex diseases. Interestingly, many of these associations involve combinations of common variations that occur in small fractions of population. Thus, our approach is an alternative methodology for exploring the genetics of rare diseases for which the current focus is on individually rare variations.},

Over the last two decades, the number of web-based pathology resources has expanded dramatically with centralized pathological resources being delivered to many students simultaneously. Recently, whole slide imaging technology allows glass slides to be scanned and viewed on a computer screen via dedicated software. This technology is referred to as virtual microscopy and has created enormous opportunities in pathological training and education. Students are able to learn key histopathological skills, e.g. to identify areas of diagnostic relevance from an entire slide, via a web-based computer environment. Students no longer need to be in the same room as the slides. New human-computer interfaces are also being developed using more natural touch technology to enhance the manipulation of digitized slides. Several major initiatives are also underway introducing online competency and diagnostic decision analysis using virtual microscopy and have important future roles in accreditation and recertification. Finally, researchers are investigating how pathological decision-making is achieved using virtual microscopy and modern eye-tracking devices. Virtual microscopy and digital pathology will continue to improve how pathology training and education is delivered.},

OBJECTIVE: To describe a prospective, multi-institutional study to determine pathologist estimation accuracy. DESIGN: Ten ×20 magnification images of hematoxylin-eosin-stained colon tissue specimens were sent as an educational component of the College of American Pathologists KRAS-B 2011 Survey. Data from 194 labs were analyzed and compared to a criterion standard with comprehensive manual nuclear counts. RESULTS: Survey responses indicated low interlaboratory precision of pathologist estimation, but mean estimates were fairly accurate. A total of 5 of the 10 cases assessed showed more than 10{\%} of respondents overestimating in a manner that could lead to false-negative test results. CONCLUSIONS: The significance of estimation errors resulting in molecular testing failures with implications for patient care is unknown, but the current study suggests false-negative test results may occur.},

abstract = {The mammalian lung is a highly branched network in which the distal regions of the bronchial tree transform during development into a densely packed honeycomb of alveolar air sacs that mediate gas exchange. Although this transformation has been studied by marker expression analysis and fate-mapping, the mechanisms that control the progression of lung progenitors along distinct lineages into mature alveolar cell types are still incompletely known, in part because of the limited number of lineage markers and the effects of ensemble averaging in conventional transcriptome analysis experiments on cell populations. Here we show that single-cell transcriptome analysis circumvents these problems and enables direct measurement of the various cell types and hierarchies in the developing lung. We used microfluidic single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on 198 individual cells at four different stages encompassing alveolar differentiation to measure the transcriptional states which define the developmental and cellular hierarchy of the distal mouse lung epithelium. We empirically classified cells into distinct groups by using an unbiased genome-wide approach that did not require a priori knowledge of the underlying cell types or the previous purification of cell populations. The results confirmed the basic outlines of the classical model of epithelial cell-type diversity in the distal lung and led to the discovery of many previously unknown cell-type markers, including transcriptional regulators that discriminate between the different populations. We reconstructed the molecular steps during maturation of bipotential progenitors along both alveolar lineages and elucidated the full life cycle of the alveolar type 2 cell lineage. This single-cell genomics approach is applicable to any developing or mature tissue to robustly delineate molecularly distinct cell types, define progenitors and lineage hierarchies, and identify lineage-specific regulatory factors.},

abstract = {INTRODUCTION
The visual search patterns of dentists and the areas that attract their attention when interpreting dental periapical radiographs are currently unknown. This research identifies areas and patterns of visual fixation when observing dental periapical radiographs. 

METHODS
In an observational study using eye tracking technology and a convenience sample of 44 observers, the interpretations of 4 dental periapical radiographs were recorded using Camtasia Software (TechSmith, Okemos, MI) with a gaze tracking “bubble” denoting where within the radiograph the observers' eyes gazed. The recorded observations included the scanning pattern, the area of first fixation, and revisits of areas. Also noted was whether the area of first fixation or revisit was radiopaque, radiolucent, or of normal radiodensity and whether it was a coronal or radicular area. 

RESULTS
The first fixation is more likely to be an area of high contrast that is either radiopaque or radiolucent compared with areas that were normal or of average gray scale. Significantly more revisits occurred on areas that were radiopaque and located in the radicular area. Of the 4 categorized scanning patterns, tooth by tooth scanning predominated. 

CONCLUSIONS
When interpreting dental periapical radiographs, significantly more observers initially fixated on areas of the radiograph that were of high contrast (ie, radiopaque or radiolucent) compared with “normal areas.” A tooth by tooth scanning pattern was most commonly used.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Few risk factors have been identified for renal cell carcinoma. We performed a validation study in a population with a European background to identify the most significant variants previously identified in association with renal cell carcinoma risk.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a case-control validation study after recruiting 463 controls and 463 patients with a histologically confirmed diagnosis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma. For each patient and matched control we genotyped 8 single nucleotide polymorphisms selected from previous studies to evaluate the association between candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms and renal cell carcinoma susceptibility.

RESULTS: After adjusting for patient age, gender, smoking status and body mass index the AG + AA genotypes from rs7105934 (11q13) were associated with a decreased risk of renal cell carcinoma (OR 0.50, 95{\%} CI 0.33-0.75, p = 0.001) and the AC + CC genotypes from rs1049380 (ITPR2) were associated with an increased risk (OR 1.66, 95{\%} CI 1.28-2.16, p {\textless}0.001). Kidney cancer developed at an older age in patients carrying the dominant risk allele A for rs7105934 (mean age at diagnosis 73.1 vs 68.9 years, p = 0.002) and at a younger age in those carrying the dominant allele C for rs1049380 (mean 68.1 vs 70.8 years, p = 0.005).

CONCLUSIONS: In what is to our knowledge the first validation study of the main 8 single nucleotide polymorphism variants associated with renal cell carcinoma susceptibility we confirmed the association of 2 single nucleotide polymorphisms with the risk of renal cell carcinoma. Each variant influenced patient age at disease diagnosis.},

abstract = {Molecular pathology is becoming more and more important in present day pathology. A major challenge for any molecular test is its ability to reliably detect mutations in samples consisting of mixtures of tumor cells and normal cells, especially when the tumor content is low. The minimum percentage of tumor cells required to detect genetic abnormalities is a major variable. Information on tumor cell percentage is essential for a correct interpretation of the result. In daily practice, the percentage of tumor cells is estimated by pathologists on hematoxylin and eosin (H{\&}E)-stained slides, the reliability of which has been questioned. This study aimed to determine the reliability of estimated tumor cell percentages in tissue samples by pathologists. On 47 H{\&}E-stained slides of lung tumors a tumor area was marked. The percentage of tumor cells within this area was estimated independently by nine pathologists, using categories of 0-5{\%}, 6-10{\%}, 11-20{\%}, 21-30{\%}, and so on, until 91-100{\%}. As gold standard, the percentage of tumor cells was counted manually. On average, the range between the lowest and the highest estimate per sample was 6.3 categories. In 33{\%} of estimates, the deviation from the gold standard was at least three categories. The mean absolute deviation was 2.0 categories (range between observers 1.5-3.1 categories). There was a significant difference between the observers (P{\textless}0.001). If 20{\%} of tumor cells were considered the lower limit to detect a mutation, samples with an insufficient tumor cell percentage ({\textless}20{\%}) would have been estimated to contain enough tumor cells in 27/72 (38{\%}) observations, possibly causing false negative results. In conclusion, estimates of tumor cell percentages on H{\&}E-stained slides are not accurate, which could result in misinterpretation of test results. Reliability could possibly be improved by using a training set with feedback.},

abstract = {In virtual microscopy, a sequential process of captures of microscopical fields, allows to construct a virtual slide which is visualized using a specialized software, called the virtual microscopy viewer. This tool allows useful exploration of images, composed of thousands of microscopical fields of view at different levels of magnification, emulating an actual microscopical examination. The aim of this study was to establish the main pathologist's navigation patterns when exploring virtual microscopy slides, using a graphical user interface, adapted to the pathologist's workflow. Four pathologists with a similar level of experience, graduated from the same pathology program, navigated six virtual slides. Different issues were evaluated, namely, the percentage of common visited image regions, the time spent at each and its coincidence level, that is to say, the region of interest location. In addition, navigation patterns were also assessed, i.e., mouse movement velocities and linearity of the diagnostic paths. Results suggest that regions of interest are determined by a complex combination of the visited area, the time spent at each visit and the coincidence level among pathologists. Additionally, linear trajectories and particular velocity patterns were found for the registered diagnostic paths.},

Each signature was validated with response data from an independent set of cell line studies. We further show that many of these signatures can accurately predict clinical response in individuals treated with these drugs. Notably, signatures developed to predict response to individual agents, when combined, could also predict response to multidrug regimens. Finally, we integrated the chemotherapy response signatures with signatures of oncogenic pathway deregulation to identify new therapeutic strategies that make use of all available drugs. The development of gene expression profiles that can predict response to commonly used cytotoxic agents provides opportunities to better use these drugs, including using them in combination with existing targeted therapies.},

Here we perform a quantitative mass spectrometry-based analysis to probe in-depth dynamic proteome changes during somatic cell reprogramming. Our data reveal defined waves of proteome resetting, with the first wave occurring 48 h after the activation of the reprogramming transgenes and involving specific biological processes linked to the c-Myc transcriptional network. A second wave of proteome reorganization occurs in a later stage of reprogramming, where we characterize the proteome of two distinct pluripotent cellular populations. In addition, the overlay of our proteome resource with parallel generated -omics data is explored to identify post-transcriptionally regulated proteins involved in key steps during reprogramming.},

image interpretation process. We investigated gaze points of CT colonography (CTC) interpretation process, and
analyzed the difference in gaze points between experts and trainees. In this study, we attempted to understand how
trainees can be improved to a level achieved by experts in viewing of CTC.
We used an eye gaze point sensing system, Gazefineder (JVCKENWOOD Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), which can
detect pupil point and corneal reflection point by the dark pupil eye tracking. This system can provide gaze points
images and excel file data. The subjects are radiological technologists who are experienced, and inexperienced in reading
CTC. We performed observer studies in reading virtual pathology images and examined observer's image interpretation
process using gaze points data. Furthermore, we examined eye tracking frequency analysis by using the Fast Fourier
Transform (FFT).
We were able to understand the difference in gaze points between experts and trainees by use of the frequency
analysis. The result of the trainee had a large amount of both high-frequency components and low-frequency components.
In contrast, both components by the expert were relatively low. Regarding the amount of eye movement in every 0.02
second we found that the expert tended to interpret images slowly and calmly. On the other hand, the trainee was moving
eyes quickly and also looking for wide areas.
We can assess the difference in the gaze points on CTC between experts and trainees by use of the eye gaze point
sensing system and based on the frequency analysis. The potential improvements in CTC interpretation for trainees can
be evaluated by using gaze points data.},

Despite its potential public health role, there have been few published studies on the effectiveness of these warnings as a health message. The present study used well-accepted market research methods to examine adolescent viewing of tobacco advertisements. Sixty-one adolescents participated in the study. Eye tracking was used to study how participants viewed five different tobacco advertisements. The average viewing time of the warning amounted to only 8{\%} of the total advertisement viewing time. In 43.6{\%} of cases, the warning was not viewed at all. Following the advertisement viewing, participants were asked to identify the observed warnings within a list that included other simulated warnings. Subjects did only slightly better than random guessing in this test of recognition. Using market research criteria, the federally mandated warning must be viewed as an ineffective public health message in so far as adolescents are concerned.(JAMA 1989;261:84-89)},

@article{Krupinski2006,
abstract = {A core skill in diagnostic pathology is light microscopy. Remarkably little is known about human factors that affect the proficiency of pathologists as light microscopists. The cognitive skills of pathologists have received relatively little attention in comparison with the large literature on human performance studies in radiology. One reason for this lack of formal visual search studies in pathology has been the physical restrictions imposed by the close positioning of a microscope operator's head to the microscope's eyepieces. This blocks access to the operator's eyes and precludes assessment of the microscopist's eye movements. Virtual slide microscopy now removes this barrier and opens the door for studies on human factors and visual search strategies in light microscopy. The aim of this study was to assess eye movements of medical students, pathology residents, and practicing pathologists examining virtual slides on a digital display monitor. Whole histopathology glass slide digital images, so-called virtual slides, of 20 consecutive breast core biopsy cases were used in a retrospective study. These high-quality virtual slides were produced with an array-microscope equipped DMetrix DX-40 ultrarapid virtual slide processor (DMetrix, Tucson, Ariz). Using an eye-tracking device, we demonstrated for the first time that when a virtual slide reader initially looks at a virtual slide his or her eyes are very quickly attracted to regions of interest (ROIs) within the slide and that these ROIs are likely to contain diagnostic information. In a matter of seconds, critical decisions are made on the selection of ROIs for further examination at higher magnification. We recorded: (1) the time virtual slide readers spent fixating on self-selected locations on the video monitor; (2) the characteristics of the ways the eyes jumped between fixation locations; and (3) x and y coordinates for each virtual slide marking the sites the virtual slide readers manually selected for zooming to higher ROI magnifications. We correlated the locations of the visually selected fixation locations and the manually selected ROIs. Viewing profiles were identified for each group. Fully trained pathologists spent significantly less time (mean, 4.471 seconds) scanning virtual slides when compared to pathology residents (mean, 7.148 seconds) or medical students (mean, 11.861 seconds), but had relatively prolonged saccadic eye movements (P {\textless} .0001). Saccadic eye movements are defined as eye movements between fixation locations. On the other hand, the pathologists spent significantly more time than trainees dwelling on the 3 locations they subsequently chose for zooming. Unlike either the medical students or the residents, the pathologists frequently choose areas for viewing at higher magnification outside of areas of foveal (central) vision. Eye movement studies of scanning pathways (scan paths) may be useful for developing eye movement profiles for individuals and for understanding the difference in performances between novices and experts. They may also be useful for developing new visual search strategies for rendering diagnoses on telepathology virtual slides. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Understanding the development and function of an organ requires the characterization of all of its cell types. Traditional methods for visualizing and isolating subpopulations of cells are based on messenger RNA or protein expression of only a few known marker genes. The unequivocal identification of a specific marker gene, however, poses a major challenge, particularly if this cell type is rare. Identifying rare cell types, such as stem cells, short-lived progenitors, cancer stem cells, or circulating tumour cells, is crucial to acquire a better understanding of normal or diseased tissue biology. To address this challenge we first sequenced the transcriptome of hundreds of randomly selected cells from mouse intestinal organoids, cultured self-organizing epithelial structures that contain all cell lineages of the mammalian intestine. Organoid buds, like intestinal crypts, harbour stem cells that continuously differentiate into a variety of cell types, occurring at widely different abundances. Since available computational methods can only resolve more abundant cell types, we developed RaceID, an algorithm for rare cell type identification in complex populations of single cells. We demonstrate that this algorithm can resolve cell types represented by only a single cell in a population of randomly sampled organoid cells. We use this algorithm to identify Reg4 as a novel marker for enteroendocrine cells, a rare population of hormone-producing intestinal cells. Next, we use Reg4 expression to enrich for these rare cells and investigate the heterogeneity within this population. RaceID confirmed the existence of known enteroendocrine lineages, and moreover discovered novel subtypes, which we subsequently validated in vivo. Having validated RaceID we then applied the algorithm to ex vivo-isolated Lgr5-positive stem cells and their direct progeny. We find that Lgr5-positive cells represent a homogenous abundant population of stem cells mixed with a rare population of Lgr5-positive secretory cells. We envision broad applicability of our method for discovering rare cell types and the corresponding marker genes in healthy and diseased organs.},

abstract = {Studies of the roles of microbial communities in the development of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have reached an important milestone. A decade of genome-wide association studies and other genetic analyses have linked IBD with loci that implicate an aberrant immune response to the intestinal microbiota. More recently, profiling studies of the intestinal microbiome have associated the pathogenesis of IBD with characteristic shifts in the composition of the intestinal microbiota, reinforcing the view that IBD results from altered interactions between intestinal microbes and the mucosal immune system. Enhanced technologies can increase our understanding of the interactions between the host and its resident microbiota and their respective roles in IBD from both a large-scale pathway view and at the metabolic level. We review important microbiome studies of patients with IBD and describe what we have learned about the mechanisms of intestinal microbiota dysfunction. We describe the recent progress in microbiome research from exploratory 16S-based studies, reporting associations of specific organisms with a disease, to more recent studies that have taken a more nuanced view, addressing the function of the microbiota by metagenomic and metabolomic methods. Finally, we propose study designs and methodologies for future investigations of the microbiome in patients with inflammatory gut and autoimmune diseases in general.},

abstract = {Background. Traditional Chinese medicine encompasses a well established alternate system of medicine based on a broad range of herbal formulations and is practiced extensively in the region for the treatment of a wide variety of diseases. In recent years, several reports describe in depth studies of the molecular ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines on the biological activities including anti-bacterial activities. The availability of a well-curated dataset of molecular ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines and accurate in-silico cheminformatics models for data mining for antitubercular agents and computational filters to prioritize molecules has prompted us to search for potential hits from these datasets. Results. We used a consensus approach to predict molecules with potential antitubercular activities from a large dataset of molecular ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines available in the public domain. We further prioritized 160 molecules based on five computational filters (SMARTSfilter) so as to avoid potentially undesirable molecules. We further examined the molecules for permeability across Mycobacterial cell wall and for potential activities against non-replicating and drug tolerant Mycobacteria. Additional in-depth literature surveys for the reported antitubercular activities of the molecular ingredients and their sources were considered for drawing support to prioritization. Conclusions. Our analysis suggests that datasets of molecular ingredients of traditional Chinese medicines offer a new opportunity to mine for potential biological activities. In this report, we suggest a proof-of-concept methodology to prioritize molecules for further experimental assays using a variety of computational tools. We also additionally suggest that a subset of prioritized molecules could be used for evaluation for tuberculosis due to their additional effect against non-replicating tuberculosis as well as the additional hepato-protection offered by the source of these ingredients.},

The vast majority of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) diagnoses reported in the New Technologies for Cervical Cancer study were blindly reviewed by 2 independent pathologists. Only H{\&}E-stained slides were used for the review. The reviewers were asked to reclassify cases using the following categories: normal CIN 1, CIN 2, CIN 3, and squamous and glandular invasive cancer. We reviewed 1,003 cases. The interobserver agreement was 0.36 (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 0.32-0.40) with an unweighted kappa and 0.54 with a weighted kappa (95{\%} CI, 0.50-0.58). The kappa values from dichotomous classifications with the threshold at CIN 2 were 0.69 (95{\%} CI, 0.64-0.73) and 0.57 (95{\%} CI, 0.51-0.63) with the threshold at CIN 3. The CIN 2 diagnosis had the lowest class-specific agreement, with fewer than 50{\%} of cases confirmed by the panel members, which supports the fact that CIN 2 is not a well-defined stage in the pathogenesis of cervical neoplasia.},

abstract = {The aim of this study was to investigate where neurologists look when they view brain computed tomography (CT) images and to evaluate how they deploy their visual attention by comparing their gaze distribution with saliency maps. Brain CT images showing cerebrovascular accidents were presented to 12 neurologists and 12 control subjects. The subjects' ocular fixation positions were recorded using an eye-tracking device (Eyelink 1000). Heat maps were created based on the eye-fixation patterns of each group and compared between the two groups. The heat maps revealed that the areas on which control subjects frequently fixated often coincided with areas identified as outstanding in saliency maps, while the areas on which neurologists frequently fixated often did not. Dwell time in regions of interest (ROI) was likewise compared between the two groups, revealing that, although dwell time on large lesions was not different between the two groups, dwell time in clinically important areas with low salience was longer in neurologists than in controls. Therefore it appears that neurologists intentionally scan clinically important areas when reading brain CT images showing cerebrovascular accidents. Both neurologists and control subjects used the "bottom-up salience" form of visual attention, although the neurologists more effectively used the "top-down instruction" form.},

Immunohistochemical evaluation incorporated both intensity and distribution of staining (HSCORE). Quantitative estrogen receptor content was determined by dextran-coated charcoal analysis and sucrose density gradient analysis. In all cases H222 Sp gamma localized in the nucleus of target cells. A semiquantitative correlation existed between HSCORE and biochemical assays for breast and endometrial tissues. The sensitivities and specificities for HSCORE as compared to the biochemical assays ranged from 80 to 95{\%} and from 74 to 94{\%}, respectively. HSCORE correlated with tumor grade for breast and endometrial carcinoma. Immunohistochemical evaluation showed no specific staining in melanomas. The data suggest that immunohistochemical receptor localization provides information complementary to standard biochemical assays in the tissues studied.},

Much of what has been learned about publication bias comes from the social sciences, less from the field of medicine. In medicine, three studies have provided direct evidence for this bias. Prevention of publication bias is important both from the scientific perspective (complete dissemination of knowledge) and from the perspective of those who combine results from a number of similar studies (meta-analysis). If treatment decisions are based on the published literature, then the literature must include all available data that is of acceptable quality. Currently, obtaining information regarding all studies undertaken in a given field is difficult, even impossible. Registration of clinical trials, and perhaps other types of studies, is the direction in which the scientific community should move.(JAMA. 1990;263:1385-1389)},

abstract = {This paper presents a new deterministic approximation technique in Bayesian networks. This method, "Expectation Propagation," unifies two previous techniques: assumed-density filtering, an extension of the Kalman filter, and loopy belief propagation, an extension of belief propagation in Bayesian networks. Loopy belief propagation , because it propagates exact belief states, is useful for a limited class of belief networks, such as those which are purely discrete. Expectation Propagation approximates the belief states by only retaining expectations, such as mean and variance, and iterates until these expectations are consistent throughout the network. This makes it applicable to hybrid networks with discrete and continuous nodes. Experiments with Gaussian mixture models show Expectation Propagation to be convincingly better than methods with similar computational cost: Laplace's method, vari-ational Bayes, and Monte Carlo. Expectation Propagation also provides an efficient algorithm for training Bayes point machine classifiers.},

abstract = {The predictions of 13 computational bottom-up saliency models and a newly introduced Multiscale Contrast Conspicuity (MCC) metric are compared with human visual conspicuity measurements. The agreement between human visual conspicuity estimates and model saliency predictions is quantified through their rank order correlation. The maximum of the computational saliency value over the target support area correlates most strongly with visual conspicuity for 12 of the 13 models. A simple multiscale contrast model and the MCC metric both yield the largest correlation with human visual target conspicuity ({\{}{\&}{\#}x003E;{\}}0.84). Local image saliency largely determines human visual inspection and interpretation of static and dynamic scenes. Computational saliency models therefore have a wide range of important applications, like adaptive content delivery, region-of-interest-based image compression, video summarization, progressive image transmission, image segmentation, image quality assessment, object recognition, and content-aware image scaling. However, current bottom-up saliency models do not incorporate important visual effects like crowding and lateral interaction. Additional knowledge about the exact nature of the interactions between the mechanisms mediating human visual saliency is required to develop these models further. The MCC metric and its associated psychophysical saliency measurement procedure are useful tools to systematically investigate the relative contribution of different feature dimensions to overall visual target saliency.},

Although there is growing interest in protein-calixarene interactions, only limited structural information has been available to date. We now report the crystal structure of a protein-calixarene complex. The water-soluble p-sulfonatocalix[4]arene is shown to bind the lysine-rich cytochrome c at three different sites. Binding curves obtained from NMR titrations reveal an interaction process that involves two or more binding sites. Together, the data indicate a dynamic complex in which the calixarene explores the surface of cytochrome c. In addition to providing valuable information on protein recognition, the data also indicate that the calixarene is a mediator of protein-protein interactions, with potential applications in generating assemblies and promoting crystallization.},

abstract = {Broadly speaking, nineteenth century statistics was Bayesian, while the twentieth century was frequentist, at least from the point of view of most scientific practitioners. Here in the twenty-first century scientists are bringing statisticians much bigger problems to solve, often comprising millions of data points and thousands of parameters. Which statistical philosophy will dominate practice? My guess, backed up with some recent examples, is that a combination of Bayesian and frequentist ideas will be needed to deal with our increasingly intense scientific environment. This will be a challenging period for statisticians, both applied and theoretical, but it also opens the opportunity for a new golden age, rivaling that of Fisher, Neyman, and the other giants of the early 1900s. What follows is the text of the 164th ASA presidential address, delivered at the awards ceremony in Toronto on August 10, 2004. Two Septembers ago, there was a conference of particle physicists and statisticians at Stanford, called phystat2003. I gave a talk at phystat2003 titled " Bayesians, Frequentists, and Physicists. " Earlier that year I'd spoken to a meeting of bio-medical researchers at the " Hutch " in Seattle, under the title " Bayesians, Frequentists, and Microbiologists. " These weren't the same lectures, and both were different than tonight's talk, but you can see that I've gotten stuck on a naming scheme. You might worry that this has gotten out of hand, and next week it might be almost anything else that ends in " ists. " But no, there is a plan here: The common theme I've been stuck on, and what I want to talk about tonight, is the impact of statistics on modern science and also the impact of modern science on statistics. Statisticians, by the nature of our profession, tend to be crit-ical thinkers, and that includes a big dose of self-criticism. It is easy to think of statistics as a small struggling field, but that's not at all what the historical record shows. Starting from just about zero in 1900, statistics has grown steadily in numbers and, more importantly, in intellectual influence. The growth process has accelerated in the past few decades as science has moved into areas where random noise is endemic and efficient inference is crucial. It's hard to imagine phystat1903, back when physicists scorned statistical methods as appropriate only for soft noisy fields like the social sciences. But physicists have their own problems with noise these days, as they try to answer questions where data are really thin on the ground. The example of great-est interest at phystat2003 concerned the mass of the neutrino, a famously elusive particle that is much lighter than an electron and may weigh almost nothing at all. The physicists' trouble was that the best unbiased estimate of the neutrino mass was negative, about −1 on a scale with unit standard error. The mass itself can't be negative of course, and these days they're pretty sure it's not zero. They wished to establish an upper bound for the mass, the smaller the better from the point of view of further experimentation. As a result, the particle physics literature now contains a healthy debate on Bayesian versus frequentist ways of setting the bound. The current favorite is a likelihood ratio-based system of one-sided confidence intervals. The physicists I talked with were really bothered by our 250-year-old Bayesian–frequentist argument. Basically, there's only one way of doing physics, but there seems to be at least two ways to do statistics, and they don't always give the same B.

The method builds on two sources of external knowledge: the growing understanding of three-dimensional spatial relationships in the genome, and the substantial repository of information about relationships among genetic variants, genes, and diseases captured in the published biomedical literature. We integrate chromatin conformation capture data (HiC) with literature support to rank putative target genes of intergenic disease-associated SNPs. We demonstrate that this hybrid method outperforms a genomic distance baseline on a small test set of expression quantitative trait loci, as well as either method individually. In addition, we show the potential for this method to uncover relationships between intergenic SNPs and target genes across chromosomes. With more extensive chromatin conformation capture data becoming readily available, this method provides a way forward towards functional interpretation of SNPs in the context of the three dimensional structure of the genome in the nucleus.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate morbidity, functional, and oncological outcomes after NSS in renal tumors {\textgreater} 7 cm.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 168 patients with tumors {\textgreater} 7 cm who were treated using NSS between 1998 and 2012.

RESULTS: Imperative and elective indications accounted for 76 (45.2{\%}) and 92 (54.8{\%}) patients, respectively. Major perioperative complications and renal function deterioration occurred in 33 (19.6{\%}) and 51 patients (30.4{\%}), respectively. In multivariate analysis, age older than 60 years (P = .001; hazard ratio [HR], 5) and tumor malignancy (P = .014; HR, 6.7) were prognostic factors for renal function deterioration whereas imperative indication was a risk factor for major postoperative complications (P = .0019; HR, 2.7). In 126 (75{\%}) patients with malignant tumors, after a median follow-up of 30 months (range, 1-254 months), 25 patients (20.2{\%}) died. In multivariate analysis, imperative indication (P = .023; HR, 4.2), positive surgical margin (P = .021; HR, 3.3), and Fuhrman grade {\textgreater} II (P = .013; HR, 3.7) were prognostic indicators for cancer-free survival (CFS). Imperative indication (P = .04; HR, 8.5) and Fuhrman grade {\textgreater} II (P = .04; HR, 3.9) were predictive factors of cancer-specific survival (CSS). In case of elective indication, positive surgical margin, local recurrence, and cancer-related death occurred in 4 (7.6{\%}), 1 (1.1{\%}), and 1 (1.1{\%}) cases, respectively. For elective indication, 5-year estimates of CFS, CSS, and overall survival rates were: 85.7{\%}, 98{\%}, and 93.9{\%}, respectively.

CONCLUSION: In this selected population, imperative vs. elective indication status seems to play a critical role in oncologic outcomes. Oncologic results for elective indications are close to those reported with radical nephrectomy.},

@article{Fumagalli2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Microarrays have revolutionized breast cancer (BC) research by enabling studies of gene expression on a transcriptome-wide scale. Recently, RNA-Sequencing (RNA-Seq) has emerged as an alternative for precise readouts of the transcriptome. To date, no study has compared the ability of the two technologies to quantify clinically relevant individual genes and microarray-derived gene expression signatures (GES) in a set of BC samples encompassing the known molecular BC's subtypes. To accomplish this, the RNA from 57 BCs representing the four main molecular subtypes (triple negative, HER2 positive, luminal A, luminal B), was profiled with Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 chips and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. The correlations of three clinically relevant BC genes, six molecular subtype classifiers, and a selection of 21 GES were evaluated. RESULTS: 16,097 genes common to the two platforms were retained for downstream analysis. Gene-wise comparison of microarray and RNA-Seq data revealed that 52{\%} had a Spearman's correlation coefficient greater than 0.7 with highly correlated genes displaying significantly higher expression levels. We found excellent correlation between microarray and RNA-Seq for the estrogen receptor (ER; rs =0.973; 95{\%}CI: 0.971-0.975), progesterone receptor (PgR; rs =0.95; 0.947-0.954), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; rs =0.918; 0.912-0.923), while a few discordances between ER and PgR quantified by immunohistochemistry and RNA-Seq/microarray were observed. All the subtype classifiers evaluated agreed well (Cohen's kappa coefficients {\textgreater}0.8) and all the proliferation-based GES showed excellent Spearman correlations between microarray and RNA-Seq (all rs {\textgreater}0.965). Immune-, stroma- and pathway-based GES showed a lower correlation relative to prognostic signatures (all rs {\textgreater}0.6). CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a systematic comparison of RNA-Seq to microarray for the evaluation of single genes and GES clinically relevant to BC. According to our results, the vast majority of single gene biomarkers and well-established GES can be reliably evaluated using the RNA-Seq technology.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Emerging molecular targeting therapeutics have been incorporated into the management of advanced renal cell carcinoma; however, their efficacy remains limited. The aim of this study was to catalog potential therapeutic target molecules for renal cell carcinoma.

METHODS: We first selected genes up-regulated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma relative to surrounding normal kidney tissues in 10 patients (Study Cohort) using high-density exon arrays that detect all potential transcripts predicted in the human genome. The selected genes were subjected to independent validation in another set of 10 patients (Validation Cohort) using real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and functional screening using small interfering RNA in six clear cell renal cell carcinoma cell lines.

RESULTS: We identified 164 genes whose expression was significantly elevated in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (P{\textless} 0.0001 [Student's t-test] and at least a 3-fold change in transcription signal). We finally extracted 33 genes required for maintaining cell proliferation in at least two clear cell renal cell carcinoma cell lines. The 33 genes included 13 genes known to be associated with the development/progression of renal cell carcinoma, including CAIX and FLT-1, confirming the robustness of the current strategy.

CONCLUSIONS: Through a combination of genome-wide expression and functional assays, we identified a set of genes with high potential as targets for drug development. This method is rapid and comprehensive and could be applied to the discovery of diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for cancers other than clear cell renal cell carcinoma.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is one of the leading genetically complex and heterogeneous disorder that is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. The underlying risk factors remain largely unclear for this heterogeneous disorder. In recent years, high throughput methodologies, such as genome-wide linkage analysis (GWL), genome-wide association (GWA) studies, and genome-wide expression profiling (GWE), have led to the identification of several candidate genes associated with AD. However, due to lack of consistency within their findings, an integrative approach is warranted. Here, we have designed a rank based gene prioritization approach involving convergent analysis of multi-dimensional data and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network modelling.

RESULTS: Our approach employs integration of three different AD datasets- GWL,GWA and GWE to identify overlapping candidate genes ranked using a novel cumulative rank score (SR) based method followed by prioritization using clusters derived from PPI network. SR for each gene is calculated by addition of rank assigned to individual gene based on either p value or score in three datasets. This analysis yielded 108 plausible AD genes. Network modelling by creating PPI using proteins encoded by these genes and their direct interactors resulted in a layered network of 640 proteins. Clustering of these proteins further helped us in identifying 6 significant clusters with 7 proteins (EGFR, ACTB, CDC2, IRAK1, APOE, ABCA1 and AMPH) forming the central hub nodes. Functional annotation of 108 genes revealed their role in several biological activities such as neurogenesis, regulation of MAP kinase activity, response to calcium ion, endocytosis paralleling the AD specific attributes. Finally, 3 potential biochemical biomarkers were found from the overlap of 108 AD proteins with proteins from CSF and plasma proteome. EGFR and ACTB were found to be the two most significant AD risk genes.

CONCLUSIONS: With the assumption that common genetic signals obtained from different methodological platforms might serve as robust AD risk markers than candidates identified using single dimension approach, here we demonstrated an integrated genomic convergence approach for disease candidate gene prioritization from heterogeneous data sources linked to AD.},

abstract = {Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequent cause of cancer deaths worldwide; nearly half contain mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase/RAS pathway. Here we show that RAS-pathway mutant NSCLC cells depend on the transcription factor GATA2. Loss of GATA2 reduced the viability of NSCLC cells with RAS-pathway mutations, whereas wild-type cells were unaffected. Integrated gene expression and genome occupancy analyses revealed GATA2 regulation of the proteasome, and IL-1-signaling, and Rho-signaling pathways. These pathways were functionally significant, as reactivation rescued viability after GATA2 depletion. In a Kras-driven NSCLC mouse model, Gata2 loss dramatically reduced tumor development. Furthermore, Gata2 deletion in established Kras mutant tumors induced striking regression. Although GATA2 itself is likely undruggable, combined suppression of GATA2-regulated pathways with clinically approved inhibitors caused marked tumor clearance. Discovery of the nononcogene addiction of KRAS mutant lung cancers to GATA2 presents a network of druggable pathways for therapeutic exploitation.},

abstract = {BackgroundNear universal administration of vaccines mandates intense pharmacovigilance for vaccine safety and a stringently low tolerance for adverse events. Reports of autoimmune diseases (AID) following vaccination have been challenging to evaluate given the high rates of vaccination, background incidence of autoimmunity, and low incidence and variable times for onset of AID after vaccinations. In order to identify biologically plausible pathways to adverse autoimmune events of vaccine-related AID, we used a systems biology approach to create a matrix of innate and adaptive immune mechanisms active in specific diseases, responses to vaccine antigens, adjuvants, preservatives and stabilizers, for the most common vaccine-associated AID found in the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System.ResultsThis report focuses on Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS), Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA), Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), and Idiopathic (or immune) Thrombocytopenic Purpura (ITP). Multiple curated databases and automated text mining of PubMed literature identified 667 genes associated with RA, 448 with SLE, 49 with ITP and 73 with GBS. While all data sources provided valuable and unique gene associations, text mining using natural language processing (NLP) algorithms provided the most information but required curation to remove incorrect associations. Six genes were associated with all four AIDs. Thirty-three pathways were shared by the four AIDs. Classification of genes into twelve immune system related categories identified more ¿Th17 T-cell subtype¿ genes in RA than the other AIDs, and more ¿Chemokine plus Receptors¿ genes associated with RA than SLE. Gene networks were visualized and clustered into interconnected modules with specific gene clusters for each AID, including one in RA with ten C-X-C motif chemokines. The intersection of genes associated with GBS, GBS peptide auto-antigens, influenza A infection, and influenza vaccination created a subnetwork of genes that inferred a possible role for the MAPK signaling pathway in influenza vaccine related GBS.ConclusionsResults showing unique and common gene sets, pathways, immune system categories and functional clusters of genes in four autoimmune diseases suggest it is possible to develop molecular classifications of autoimmune and inflammatory events. Combining this information with cellular and other disease responses should greatly aid in the assessment of potential immune-mediated adverse events following vaccination.},

Percent positive cells and intensity of staining increased significantly with increased grade of disease. Forced expression of SETDB1 in NSCLC cell lines enhanced their clonogenic growth in vitro and markedly increased tumor size in a murine xenograft model; while silencing (shRNA) SETDB1 in NSCLC cells slowed their proliferation. SETDB1 positively stimulated activity of the WNT/$\beta$-catenin pathway and diminished P53 expression resulting in enhanced NSCLC growth in vitro and in vivo. Our finding suggests therapeutic targeting SETDB1 may benefit patients whose tumors express high levels of SETDB1.},

Here, a generic approach to cancer classification based on gene expression monitoring by DNA microarrays is described and applied to human acute leukemias as a test case. A class discovery procedure automatically discovered the distinction between acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) without previous knowledge of these classes. An automatically derived class predictor was able to determine the class of new leukemia cases. The results demonstrate the feasibility of cancer classification based solely on gene expression monitoring and suggest a general strategy for discovering and predicting cancer classes for other types of cancer, independent of previous biological knowledge.},

Record on adverse reactions and allergies from antibiotics considerably affect the prescription choices. We consider this a biomedical decision-making problem and explore hidden knowledge in survey results on data extracted from a big data pool of health records of children, from the Health Center of Osijek, Eastern Croatia.

RESULTS: We applied and evaluated a k-means algorithm to the dataset to generate some clusters which have similar features. Our results highlight that some type of antibiotics form different clusters, which insight is most helpful for the clinician to support better decision-making.

CONCLUSIONS: Medical professionals can investigate the clusters which our study revealed, thus gaining useful knowledge and insight into this data for their clinical studies.},

Here, we show that a deep autoencoder coupled to a Bayesian model remarkably improves UMI-based scRNA-seq data quality by transfer learning across datasets. This new technology, SAVER-X, outperforms existing state-of-the-art tools. The deep learning model in SAVER-X extracts transferable gene expression features across data from different labs, generated by varying technologies, and obtained from divergent species. Through this framework, we explore the limits of transfer learning in a diverse testbed and demonstrate that future human sequencing projects will unequivocally benefit from the accumulation of publicly available data. We further show, through examples in immunology and neurodevelopment, that SAVER-X can harness existing public data to enhance downstream analysis of new data, such as those collected in clinical settings.},

abstract = {Whole-genome association studies (WGAS) bring new computational, as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

abstract = {Aspects of the development of mass spectrometry over the past three decades are briefly reviewed and growth points in the subject are identified. Molecular imaging by mass spectrometry is one such growth area. The development of a capability for 2D chemical imaging of surfaces is described, based on the combination of a desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) ion source with an automated surface stage capable of x, y translational motion. The lateral resolution of this new system is found to be less than 200 microns, using a test ink pattern. Chemical imaging of surfaces is demonstrated using model examples of organic and biological systems: (i) imaging of a 2D pattern written in different colored inks on photographic paper and (ii) imaging of thin coronal sections of rat brain tissue fixed onto a glass microscope slide. In both cases, full mass spectra are recorded as a function of x,y-position on the surface. In the chemical imaging example, the distributions of the two different inks on the paper surface were mapped by tracking the abundance of the intact organic cation which characterizes each particular ink dye. In the tissue imaging example, distributions of specific lipids in coronal sections of rat brain tissue were followed from the abundance distributions in 2D space of the deprotonated lipid molecules recorded in the negative ion mass spectra. These latter distributions reveal distinct anatomical features of the rat brain. The results of these studies demonstrate the feasibility of performing surface imaging studies using DESI and show that at this stage of its development it has a lateral spatial resolution of a few hundred microns. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

In the present study, we showed that miR-181c, a commonly downregulated miRNA in GBM reported by several miRNA profiles, was associated with the mesenchymal subtype of GBM and predicted the outcome for patients from a GBM cohort (n=518) obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. A multivariate analysis showed that miR-181c was an independent prognostic indicator for GBM patients. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR showed that miR-181c was expressed poorly in neurospheres of glioma cells that resemble glioma stem cells. Proliferation and invasion assays showed that miR-181c also blocked the proliferation and invasion abilities of glioma cells. Limiting dilution and colony formation assays showed that miR-181c attenuated the self-renewal ability of glioma cells. Finally, investigation of the mechanism defined Notch2, a key molecular of Notch signaling, as the functional downstream target of miR-181c. An inverse correlation was found between miR-181c and Notch2 in glioma cells and verified in fresh glioma samples. Taken together, the present study showed that miR-181c can be considered a valuable indicator for the outcome of GBM patients. miR-181c acts as a tumor suppressor that attenuates proliferation, invasion, and self-renewal capacities by downregulation of Notch2 in glioma cells.},

abstract = {AIMS: To describe the theory and develop an automated virtual slide screening system. Theoretical considerations. Tissue-based diagnosis separates into (a) sampling procedure to allocate the slide area containing diagnostic information, and (b) evaluation of diagnosis from the selected area. Nyquist's theorem broadly applied in acoustics, serves to presetting the sampling accuracy. Tissue-based diagnosis relies on two different information systems: (a) texture, and (b) object information. Texture information can be derived by recursive formulas without image segmentation. Object information requires image segmentation and feature extraction. Both algorithms complete another to a "self-learning" classification system. METHODS: Non-overlapping compartments of the original virtual slide (image) are chosen at random with predefined error-rate (Nyquist's theorem). The standardized image compartments are subject for texture and object analysis. The recursive formula of texture analysis computes median gray values and local noise distribution. Object analysis includes automated measurements of immunohistochemically stained slides. The computations performed at different magnifications (x 2, x 4.5, x 10, x 20, x 40) are subject to multivariate statistically analysis and diagnosis classification. RESULTS: A total of 808 lung cancer cases of diagnoses groups: cohort (1) normal lung (318 cases) - cancer (490 cases); cancer subdivided: cohort (2) small cell lung cancer (10 cases) - non-small cell lung cancer (480 cases); non-small cell lung cancer subdivided: cohort (3) squamous cell carcinoma (318 cases) - adenocarcinoma (194 cases) - large cell carcinoma (70 cases) was analyzed. Cohorts (1) and (2) were classified correctly in 100{\%}, cohort (3) in more than 95{\%}. The selected area can be limited to 10{\%} of the original image without increased error rate. A second approach included 233 breast tissue cases (105 normal, 128 breast carcinomas) and 88 lung tissue cases (58 normal, 38 cancer). Texture analysis revealed a correct classification with only 10 training set cases in {\textgreater}92{\%} for both, breast and lung tissue. CONCLUSIONS: The developed system is a fast and reliable procedure to fulfill all requirements for an automated "pre-screening" of virtual slides in tissue-based diagnosis.},

It remains to be determined whether IBS symptoms are caused by alterations in brain signaling from the intestine to the microbiota or primary disruption of the microbiota, and whether they are involved in altered interactions between the brain and intestine during development. We review the potential mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of IBS in different groups of patients. Studies are needed to better characterize alterations to the intestinal microbiome in large cohorts of well-phenotyped patients, and to correlate intestinal metabolites with specific abnormalities in gut-brain interactions.},

CTCF is ubiquitously expressed and plays diverse roles in gene regulation, imprinting, insulation, intra/interchromosomal interactions, nuclear compartmentalisation, and alternative splicing. CTCF has a single paralogue, the testes-specific CTCF-like gene (CTCFL)/BORIS. CTCF and BORIS can be deregulated in cancer. The tumour suppressor gene CTCF can be mutated or deleted in cancer, or CTCF DNA binding can be altered by epigenetic changes. BORIS is aberrantly expressed frequently in cancer, leading some to propose a pro-tumourigenic role for BORIS. However, BORIS can inhibit cell proliferation, and is mutated in cancer similarly to CTCF suggesting BORIS activation in cancer may be due to global genetic or epigenetic changes typical of malignant transformation.},

abstract = {Digital pathology and the adoption of image analysis have grown rapidly in the last few years. This is largely due to the implementation of whole slide scanning, advances in software and computer processing capacity and the increasing importance of tissue-based research for biomarker discovery and stratified medicine. This review sets out the key application areas for digital pathology and image analysis, with a particular focus on research and biomarker discovery. A variety of image analysis applications are reviewed including nuclear morphometry and tissue architecture analysis, but with emphasis on immunohistochemistry and fluorescence analysis of tissue biomarkers. Digital pathology and image analysis have important roles across the drug/companion diagnostic development pipeline including biobanking, molecular pathology, tissue microarray analysis, molecular profiling of tissue and these important developments are reviewed. Underpinning all of these important developments is the need for high quality tissue samples and the impact of pre-analytical variables on tissue research is discussed. This requirement is combined with practical advice on setting up and running a digital pathology laboratory. Finally, we discuss the need to integrate digital image analysis data with epidemiological, clinical and genomic data in order to fully understand the relationship between genotype and phenotype and to drive discovery and the delivery of personalized medicine. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Respiratory diseases are multifactorial heterogeneous diseases that have proved recalcitrant to understanding using focused molecular techniques. This trend has led to the rise of 'omics approaches (e.g., transcriptomics, proteomics) and subsequent acquisition of large-scale datasets consisting of multiple variables. In 'omics technology-based investigations, discrepancies between the number of variables analyzed (e.g., mRNA, proteins, metabolites) and the number of study subjects constitutes a major statistical challenge. The application of traditional univariate statistical methods (e.g., t-test) to these "short-and-wide" datasets may result in high numbers of false positives, while the predominant approach of p-value correction to account for these high false positive rates (e.g., FDR, Bonferroni) are associated with significant losses in statistical power. In other words, the benefit in decreased false positives must be counterbalanced with a concomitant loss in true positives. As an alternative, multivariate statistical analysis (MVA) is increasingly being employed to cope with 'omics-based data structures. When properly applied, MVA approaches can be powerful tools for integration and interpretation of complex 'omics-based datasets towards the goal of identifying biomarkers and/or subphenotypes. However, MVA methods are also prone to over-interpretation and misuse. A common software used in biomedical research to perform MVA-based analyses is the SIMCA package, which includes multiple MVA methods. In this opinion piece, we propose guidelines for minimum reporting standards for a SIMCA-based workflow, in terms of data preprocessing (e.g., normalization, scaling) and model statistics (number of components, R2, Q2, and CV-ANOVA p-value). Examples of these applications in recent COPD and asthma studies are provided. It is expected that readers will gain an increased understanding of the power and utility of MVA methods for applications in biomedical research.},

abstract = {The mouse inner cell mass (ICM) segregates into the epiblast and primitive endoderm (PrE) lineages coincident with implantation of the embryo. The epiblast subsequently undergoes considerable expansion of cell numbers prior to gastrulation. To investigate underlying regulatory principles, we performed systematic single-cell RNA sequencing (seq) of conceptuses from E3.5 to E6.5. The epiblast shows reactivation and subsequent inactivation of the X chromosome, with Zfp57 expression associated with reactivation and inactivation together with other candidate regulators. At E6.5, the transition from epiblast to primitive streak is linked with decreased expression of polycomb subunits, suggesting a key regulatory role. Notably, our analyses suggest elevated transcriptional noise at E3.5 and within the non-committed epiblast at E6.5, coinciding with exit from pluripotency. By contrast, E6.5 primitive streak cells became highly synchronized and exhibit a shortened G1 cell-cycle phase, consistent with accelerated proliferation. Our study systematically charts transcriptional noise and uncovers molecular processes associated with early lineage decisions.},

abstract = {RELEVANCE: Acupuncture is an intrinsic part of traditional Chinese medicine. The current understanding of the acupuncture meridian system, acupoints and the potential utilizing Omics technologies are summarized in this review.

MATERIAL AND METHODS: A systematic search for acupuncture involving Omics technologies was carried out using multiple online literature databases. The records retrieved were from the full collections of each database dated to September 2011. Data produced from functional genomic technologies were extracted from the collected acupuncture/moxibustion studies and subjected to evaluation. Analyses and comments were summarized on the advances in experimental research in acupuncture/moxibustion-related studies, and the future for strategies and approaches in the era of functional genomics highlighted.

RESULTS: An overview of articles indicated that several diseases or symptoms with evidence of effectiveness had been piloted for using functional genomic technologies, such as Parkinson's disease, allergic disorders, pain, and spinal cord injury, most of which are chronic "difficult diseases". High-throughput genomic and proteomic profiling of gene expression in tissues has been able to identify potential candidates for the effects of acupuncture and provide valuable information toward understanding the possible mechanisms of the therapy. However, without further holistic and sophisticated analyses in the context of metabolomics and systems biology, the current attempts and the foreseeable developments appear to be insufficient to produce firm conclusions. Noticeably, the recent rapid advances in functional molecular imaging targeting specific metabolites have shown great promise and if combined with other post-genomic technologies, could be extremely helpful for the acupuncture studies in human subjects.

CONCLUSION: This review suggest that disease-oriented studies using the approach of multi-indexed high-throughput technologies and systems biology analyses will be a preferred strategy for future acupuncture/moxibustion research.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diluted preparations obtained from Apis mellifica are reported in the homeopathic literature to have anti-inflammatory activity. The present study was designed to explore the effects on global gene expression profiles of human cells by means of microarrays, using Apis mellifica mother tincture (TM) and its 3C, 5C, 7C dynamized dilutions; the technique employed allowed us to study the changes in gene expression at concentrations much lower than those associated with pharmacological responses.

METHODS: An RWPE-1 cell line (human immortalized prostate epithelial cells) was used to study the effects on global gene expression by transcriptomic analysis.

RESULTS: Apis mellifica TM and its 3C, 5C, 7C dynamized dilutions modulated hundreds of genes; using cluster analysis we observed groups of genes up- or down-regulated with similar expression profiles among treatments; other genes showed opposite regulation profiles at low and high dilutions of Apis mellifica, suggesting a hormetic response. In particular, genes involved in cytokine expression, inflammatory processes, anti-oxidative responses and proteasome degradation were differentially, and sometimes divergently expressed by the TM or by Apis mellifica 3C, 5C and 7C dilutions. We confirmed these data by RT-PCR analyses on 5 selected candidate genes (IL1$\beta$, CD46, ATF1, UBE2Q2 and MT1X).

CONCLUSIONS: Apis mellifica TM modifies gene expression in human cells and has inhibitory effects on regulatory processes of inflammation; in addition, extremely diluted dynamized dilutions (3C, 5C and 7C) still exert significant effects on genes involved in inflammation and oxidative stress.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to clarify genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in renal tumors of various histological subtypes.

METHODS: Bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) array-based methylated CpG island amplification was performed using tissue samples of 17 patients with papillary renal cell carcinomas (RCCs), chromophobe RCCs and oncocytomas, and the results were compared with those from 51 patients with clear cell RCCs.

RESULTS: Unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis based on DNA methylation status clustered type 1 and type 2 papillary RCCs into different subclasses. Although chromophobe RCCs and oncocytomas were clustered into the same subclass, the DNA methylation status of 21 BAC clones was able to discriminate chromophobe RCCs from oncocytomas. The number of BAC clones showing DNA methylation alteration in non-tumorous renal tissue from patients with chromophobe RCCs and oncocytomas was smaller than that from patients with clear cell RCCs. Biphasic accumulation of DNA methylation alterations was observed in non-tumorous renal tissue from all 68 patients, and patients showing such alterations on more BAC clones had a poorer outcome than patients showing them on fewer BAC clones.

CONCLUSIONS: DNA methylation profiles determining the histological subtypes of renal tumors developing in individual patients and/or patient outcome may be already established in non-tumorous renal tissue at the precancerous stage.},

abstract = {Wilms' tumour (WT) is a pediatric tumor of the kidney that arises via failure of the fetal developmental program. The absence of identifiable mutations in the majority of WTs suggests the frequent involvement of epigenetic aberrations in WT. We therefore conducted a genome-wide analysis of promoter hypermethylation in WTs and identified hypermethylation at chromosome 5q31 spanning 800 kilobases (kb) and more than 50 genes. The methylated genes all belong to alpha-, beta-, and gamma-protocadherin (PCDH) gene clusters (Human Genome Organization nomenclature PCDHA@, PCDHB@, and PCDHG@, respectively). This demonstrates that long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES) occurs in developmental tumors as well as in adult tumors. Bisulfite polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that PCDH hypermethylation is a frequent event found in all Wilms' tumor subtypes. Hypermethylation is concordant with reduced PCDH expression in tumors. WT precursor lesions showed no PCDH hypermethylation, suggesting that de novo PCDH hypermethylation occurs during malignant progression. Discrete boundaries of the PCDH domain are delimited by abrupt changes in histone modifications; unmethylated genes flanking the LRES are associated with permissive marks which are absent from methylated genes within the domain. Silenced genes are marked with non-permissive histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation. Expression analysis of embryonic murine kidney and differentiating rat metanephric mesenchymal cells demonstrates that Pcdh expression is developmentally regulated and that Pcdhg@ genes are expressed in blastemal cells. Importantly, we show that PCDHs negatively regulate canonical Wnt signalling, as short-interfering RNA-induced reduction of PCDHG@ encoded proteins leads to elevated beta-catenin protein, increased beta-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) reporter activity, and induction of Wnt target genes. Conversely, over-expression of PCDHs suppresses beta-catenin/TCF-reporter activity and also inhibits colony formation and growth of cancer cells in soft agar. Thus PCDHs are candidate tumor suppressors that modulate regulatory pathways critical in development and disease, such as canonical Wnt signaling.},

Navigation of digitized slides is interactive and intended to simulate viewing glass slides with a microscope (virtual microscopy). Image viewing software permits users to edit, annotate, analyze, and easily share whole slide images (WSI). As a result, WSI have begun to replace the traditional light microscope, offering a myriad of opportunities for education. This article focuses on current applications of WSI in education and proficiency testing. WSI has been successfully explored for graduate education (medical, dental, and veterinary schools), training of pathology residents, as an educational tool in allied pathology schools (e.g., cytotechnology), for virtual tracking and tutoring, tele-education (tele-conferencing), e-learning, virtual workshops, at tumor boards, with interactive publications, and on examinations. WSI supports flexible and cost-effective distant learning and augments problem-oriented teaching, competency evaluation, and proficiency testing. WSI viewed on touchscreen displays and with tablet technology are especially beneficial for education. Further investigation is necessary to develop superior WSI applications that better support education and to design viewing stations with ergonomic tools that improve the WSI-human interface and navigation of virtual slides. Studies to determine the impact of training pathologists without exposure to actual glass slides are also needed.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The Virtual Microscopy based on completely digitalised histological slide. Concerning this digitalisation many new features in mircoscopy can be processed by the computer. New applications are possible or old, well known techniques of image analyses can be adapted for routine use. AIMS: A so called diagnostic path observes in the way of a professional sees through a histological virtual slide combined with the text information of the dictation process. This feature can be used for image retrieval, quality assurance or for educational purpose. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The diagnostic path implements a metadata structure of image information. It stores and processes the different images seen by a pathologist during his "slide viewing" and the obtained image sequence ("observation path"). Contemporary, the structural details of the pathology reports were analysed. The results were transferred into an XML structure. Based on this structure, a report editor and a search function were implemented. The report editor compiles the "diagnostic path", which is the connection from the image viewing sequence ("observation path") and the oral report sequence of the findings ("dictation path"). The time set ups of speech and image viewing serve for the link between the two sequences. The search tool uses the obtained diagnostic path. It allows the user to search for particular histological hallmarks in pathology reports and in the corresponding images. RESULTS: The new algorithm was tested on 50 pathology reports and 74 attached histological images. The creation of a new individual diagnostic path is automatically performed during the routine diagnostic process. The test prototype experienced an insignificant prolongation of the diagnosis procedure (oral case description and stated diagnosis by the pathologist) and a fast and reliable retrieval, especially useful for continuous education and quality control of case description and diagnostic work. DISCUSSION: The Digital Virtual Microscope has been designed to handle 1000 images per day in the daily routine work of a pathology institution. It implies the necessity of an automatic mechanism of image meta dating. The non - deterministic correlation between the oral statements (case report) and image information content guides the image meta dating. The presented software opens up new possibilities for a content oriented search in a virtual slide, and can successfully support medical education and diagnostic quality assurance.},

abstract = {Digital whole slide imaging is an increasingly common medium in pathology, with application to education, telemedicine, and rendering second opinions. It has also made it possible to use eye tracking devices to explore the dynamic visual inspection and interpretation of histopathological features of tissue while pathologists review cases. Using whole slide images, the present study examined how a pathologist's diagnosis is influenced by fixed case-level factors, their prior clinical experience, and their patterns of visual inspection. Participating pathologists interpreted one of two test sets, each containing 12 digital whole slide images of breast biopsy specimens. Cases represented four diagnostic categories as determined via expert consensus: benign without atypia, atypia, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), and invasive cancer. Each case included one or more regions of interest (ROIs) previously determined as of critical diagnostic importance. During pathologist interpretation we tracked eye movements, viewer tool behavior (zooming, panning), and interpretation time. Models were built using logistic and linear regression with generalized estimating equations, testing whether variables at the level of the pathologists, cases, and visual interpretive behavior would independently and/or interactively predict diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. Diagnostic accuracy varied as a function of case consensus diagnosis, replicating earlier research. As would be expected, benign cases tended to elicit false positives, and atypia, DCIS, and invasive cases tended to elicit false negatives. Pathologist experience levels, case consensus diagnosis, case difficulty, eye fixation durations, and the extent to which pathologists' eyes fixated within versus outside of diagnostic ROIs, all independently or interactively predicted diagnostic accuracy. Higher zooming behavior predicted a tendency to over-interpret benign and atypia cases, but not DCIS cases. Efficiency was not predicted by pathologist- or visual search-level variables. Results provide new insights into the medical interpretive process and demonstrate the complex interactions between pathologists and cases that guide diagnostic decision-making. Implications for training, clinical practice, and computer-aided decision aids are considered.},

abstract = {Most genes, proteins and other components carry out their functions within a complex network of interactions and a single molecule can affect a wide range of other cell components. A global, integrative, approach has been developed for several years, including protein-protein interaction networks (interactomes). In this review, we describe the high-throughput methods used to identify new interactions and to build large interaction datasets. The minimum information required for reporting a molecular interaction experiment (MIMIx) has been defined as a standard for storing data in publicly available interaction databases. Several examples of interaction networks from molecular machines (proteasome) or organelles (phagosome, mitochondrion) to whole organisms (viruses, bacteria, yeast, fly, and worm) are given and attempts to cover the entire human interaction network are discussed. The methods used to perform the topological analysis of interaction networks and to extract biological information from them are presented. These investigations have provided clues on protein functions, signalling and metabolic pathways, and physiological processes, unraveled the molecular basis of some diseases (cancer, infectious diseases), and will be very useful to identify new therapeutic targets and for drug discovery. A major challenge is now to integrate data from different sources (interactome, transcriptome, phenome, localization) to switch from static to dynamic interaction networks. The merging of a viral interactome and the human interactome has been used to simulate viral infection, paving the way for future studies aiming at providing molecular basis of human diseases.},

We have used a genome-wide strategy (methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) and whole-genome array analysis in combination with high-density expression array analysis) to identify genes that are frequently methylated and silenced in RCC. MeDIP analysis on 9 RCC tumours and 3 non-malignant normal kidney tissue samples was performed, and an initial shortlist of 56 candidate genes that were methylated by array analysis was further investigated; 9 genes were confirmed to show frequent promoter region methylation in primary RCC tumour samples (KLHL35 (39{\%}), QPCT (19{\%}), SCUBE3 (19{\%}), ZSCAN18 (32{\%}), CCDC8 (35{\%}), FBN2 (34{\%}), ATP5G2 (36{\%}), PCDH8 (58{\%}) and CORO6 (22{\%})). RNAi knockdown for KLHL35, QPCT, SCUBE3, ZSCAN18, CCDC8 and FBN2 resulted in an anchorage-independent growth advantage.

abstract = {Data mining, also known as Knowledge-Discovery in Databases (KDD), is the process of automatically searching large volumes of data for patterns. For instance, a clinical pattern might indicate a female who have diabetes or hypertension are easier suffered from stroke for 5 years in a future. Then, a physician can learn valuable knowledge from the data mining processes. Here, we present a study focused on the investigation of the application of artificial intelligence and data mining techniques to the prediction models of breast cancer. The artificial neural network, decision tree, logistic regression, and genetic algorithm were used for the comparative studies and the accuracy and positive predictive value of each algorithm were used as the evaluation indicators. 699 records acquired from the breast cancer patients at the University of Wisconsin, nine predictor variables, and one outcome variable were incorporated for the data analysis followed by the tenfold cross-validation. The results revealed that the accuracies of logistic regression model were 0.9434 (sensitivity 0.9716 and specificity 0.9482), the decision tree model 0.9434 (sensitivity 0.9615, specificity 0.9105), the neural network model 0.9502 (sensitivity 0.9628, specificity 0.9273), and the genetic algorithm model 0.9878 (sensitivity 1, specificity 0.9802). The accuracy of the genetic algorithm was significantly higher than the average predicted accuracy of 0.9612. The predicted outcome of the logistic regression model was higher than that of the neural network model but no significant difference was observed. The average predicted accuracy of the decision tree model was 0.9435 which was the lowest of all four predictive models. The standard deviation of the tenfold cross-validation was rather unreliable. This study indicated that the genetic algorithm model yielded better results than other data mining models for the analysis of the data of breast cancer patients in terms of the overall accuracy of the patient classification, the expression and complexity of the classification rule. The results showed that the genetic algorithm described in the present study was able to produce accurate results in the classification of breast cancer data and the classification rule identified was more acceptable and comprehensible.},

abstract = {Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, known together as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), are severe autoimmune disorders now causing gut inflammation and ulceration, among other symptoms, in up to 1 in 250 people worldwide. Incidence and prevalence of IBD have been increasing dramatically over the past several decades, although the causes for this increase are still unknown. IBD has both a complex genotype and a complex phenotype, and although it has received substantial attention from the medical research community over recent years, much of the etiology remains unexplained. Genome-wide association studies have identified a rich genetic signature of disease risk in patients with IBD, consisting of at least 163 genetic loci. Many of these loci contain genes directly involved in microbial handling, indicating that the genetic architecture of the disease has been driven by host-microbe interactions. In addition, systematic shifts in gut microbiome structure (enterotype) and function have been observed in patients with IBD. Furthermore, both the host genotype and enterotype are associated with aspects of the disease phenotype, including location of the disease. This provides strong evidence of interactions between host genotype and enterotype; however, there is a lack of published multi-omics data from IBD patients, and a lack of bioinformatics tools for modeling such systems. In this article we discuss, from a computational biologist's point of view, the potential benefits of and the challenges involved in designing and analyzing such multi-omics studies of IBD.},

abstract = {In an effort toward standardization, this paper evaluates the performance of five eye-movement classification algorithms in terms of their assessment of oculomotor fixation and saccadic behavior. The results indicate that performance of these five commonly used algorithms vary dramatically, even in the case of a simple stimulus-evoked task using a single, common threshold value. The important contributions of this paper are: evaluation and comparison of performance of five algorithms to classify specific oculomotor behavior; introduction and comparison of new standardized scores to provide more reliable classification performance; logic for a reasonable threshold-value selection for any eye-movement classification algorithm based on the standardized scores; and logic for establishing a criterion-based baseline for performance comparison between any eye-movement classification algorithms. Proposed techniques enable efficient and objective clinical applications providing means to assure meaningful automated eye-movement classification.},

@article{Morin-Adeline2014,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Few, if any, protozoan parasites are reported to exhibit extreme organ tropism like the flagellate Tritrichomonas foetus. In cattle, T. foetus infects the reproductive system causing abortion, whereas the infection in cats results in chronic large bowel diarrhoea. In the absence of a T. foetus genome, we utilized a de novo approach to assemble the transcriptome of the bovine and feline genotype to identify host-specific adaptations and virulence factors specific to each genotype. Furthermore, a subset of orthologs was used to characterize putative druggable targets and expose complications of in silico drug target mining in species with indefinite host-ranges.

RESULTS: Illumina RNA-seq reads were assembled into two representative bovine and feline transcriptomes containing 42,363 and 36,559 contigs, respectively. Coding and non-coding regions of the genome libraries revealed striking similarities, with 24,620 shared homolog pairs reduced down to 7,547 coding orthologs between the two genotypes. The transcriptomes were near identical in functional category distribution; with no indication of selective pressure acting on orthologs despite differences in parasite origins/host. Orthologs formed a large proportion of highly expressed transcripts in both genotypes (bovine genotype: 76{\%}, feline genotype: 56{\%}). Mining the libraries for protease virulence factors revealed the cysteine proteases (CP) to be the most common. In total, 483 and 445 bovine and feline T. foetus transcripts were identified as putative proteases based on MEROPS database, with 9 hits to putative protease inhibitors. In bovine T. foetus, CP8 is the preferentially transcribed CP while in the feline genotype, transcription of CP7 showed higher abundance. In silico druggability analysis of the two genotypes revealed that when host sequences are taken into account, drug targets are genotype-specific.

CONCLUSION: Gene discovery analysis based on RNA-seq data analysis revealed prominent similarities between the bovine and feline T. foetus, suggesting recent adaptation to their respective host/niche. T. foetus represents a unique case of a mammalian protozoan expanding its parasitic grasp across distantly related host lineages. Consequences of the host-range for in silico drug targeting are exposed here, demonstrating that targets of the parasite in one host are not necessarily ideal for the same parasite in another host.},

abstract = {Diabetic kidney disease, or diabetic nephropathy (DN), is a major complication of diabetes and the leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) that requires dialysis treatment or kidney transplantation. In addition to the decrease in the quality of life, DN accounts for a large proportion of the excess mortality associated with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Whereas the degree of glycemia plays a pivotal role in DN, a subset of individuals with poorly controlled T1D do not develop DN. Furthermore, strong familial aggregation supports genetic susceptibility to DN. However, the genes and the molecular mechanisms behind the disease remain poorly understood, and current therapeutic strategies rarely result in reversal of DN. In the GEnetics of Nephropathy: an International Effort (GENIE) consortium, we have undertaken a meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of T1D DN comprising {\~{}}2.4 million single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) imputed in 6,691 individuals. After additional genotyping of 41 top ranked SNPs representing 24 independent signals in 5,873 individuals, combined meta-analysis revealed association of two SNPs with ESRD: rs7583877 in the AFF3 gene (P = 1.2 × 10(-8)) and an intergenic SNP on chromosome 15q26 between the genes RGMA and MCTP2, rs12437854 (P = 2.0 × 10(-9)). Functional data suggest that AFF3 influences renal tubule fibrosis via the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-$\beta$1) pathway. The strongest association with DN as a primary phenotype was seen for an intronic SNP in the ERBB4 gene (rs7588550, P = 2.1 × 10(-7)), a gene with type 2 diabetes DN differential expression and in the same intron as a variant with cis-eQTL expression of ERBB4. All these detected associations represent new signals in the pathogenesis of DN.},

This "second-generation" concept decouples image acquisition from focusing, allowing for rapid scanning while maintaining continuous accurate focus. The technical concepts, merits, and limitations of this method are explained and compared to that of a traditional whole slide scanning system.},

@article{Johnson2010,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: As we enter an era when testing millions of SNPs in a single gene association study will become the standard, consideration of multiple comparisons is an essential part of determining statistical significance. Bonferroni adjustments can be made but are conservative due to the preponderance of linkage disequilibrium (LD) between genetic markers, and permutation testing is not always a viable option. Three major classes of corrections have been proposed to correct the dependent nature of genetic data in Bonferroni adjustments: permutation testing and related alternatives, principal components analysis (PCA), and analysis of blocks of LD across the genome. We consider seven implementations of these commonly used methods using data from 1514 European American participants genotyped for 700,078 SNPs in a GWAS for AIDS.

RESULTS: A Bonferroni correction using the number of LD blocks found by the three algorithms implemented by Haploview resulted in an insufficiently conservative threshold, corresponding to a genome-wide significance level of $\alpha$ = 0.15 - 0.20. We observed a moderate increase in power when using PRESTO, SLIDE, and simpleℳ when compared with traditional Bonferroni methods for population data genotyped on the Affymetrix 6.0 platform in European Americans ($\alpha$ = 0.05 thresholds between 1 × 10(-7) and 7 × 10(-8)).

CONCLUSIONS: Correcting for the number of LD blocks resulted in an anti-conservative Bonferroni adjustment. SLIDE and simpleℳ are particularly useful when using a statistical test not handled in optimized permutation testing packages, and genome-wide corrected p-values using SLIDE, are much easier to interpret for consumers of GWAS studies.},

The present study was to evaluate the expression of SETDB1 in prostate cancer (PCa) tissues and cells and to preliminarily investigate the role of SETDB1 in prostate tumorigenesis in vitro. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to detect the expression of SETDB1 in PCa tissues, adjacent normal tissues, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) tissues, PCa cell lines and normal prostate epithelial cells. The results suggested that SETDB1 was upregulated in human PCa tissues compared with normal tissues at the mRNA and protein levels. The role of SETDB1 in proliferation was analyzed with cell counting kit-8, colony-forming efficiency and flow cytometry assays. The results indicated that downregulation of SETDB1 by siRNA inhibited PCa cell growth, and induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. The PCa cell migration and invasion decreased by silcencing SETDB1 which were assessed by using in vitro scratch and transwell invasion assay respectively. Our data suggested that SETDB1 is overexpressed in human PCa. Silencing SETDB1 inhibited PCa cell proliferation, migration and invasion.},

abstract = {Many studies have recently suggested that microRNAs (miRNAs) contribute to the development of various types of human cancers as well as to their invasive and metastatic capacities. Previously, our miRNA expression signature of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) revealed that microRNA‑138 (miR‑138) was significantly reduced in cancer cells. The aim of the present study was to investigate the functional significance of miR‑138 and to identify its target genes in RCC cells. Restoration of mature miR‑138 in two RCC cell lines (A498 and 786‑O) caused changes in the bleb-like cell morphology, characteristics of the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). Restoration also significantly inhibited migration and invasion in the two RCC cell lines, suggesting that miR‑138 functions as a tumor suppressor. Genome-wide gene expression analysis (miR‑138 transfectants and RCC clinical specimens) and TargetScan database studies showed that vimentin (VIM) is a promising candidate target gene of miR‑138. It is well known that VIM is one of the most widely expressed mammalian intermediate filament proteins. Recent studies showed that VIM functions in cell adhesion, migration, survival and cell signaling processes via dynamic assembly/disassembly in cancer cells. We focused on VIM and investigated whether VIM was regulated by tumor suppressive miR‑138 and contributed to cancer cell migration and invasion in RCC cells. Restoration of miR‑138 in RCC cell lines suppressed VIM expression at both the mRNA and protein levels. Silencing studies of VIM in RCC cell lines demonstrated significant inhibition of cell migration and invasion activities in si-VIM transfectants. In clinical specimens of RCC, the expression levels of VIM were significantly upregulated in cancer tissues compared to adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry showed that VIM expression levels in RCC specimens were significantly higher than those in normal renal tissues. These data suggest that VIM may function as an oncogene and is regulated by tumor suppressive miR‑138. The existence of a tumor suppressive miR‑138-mediated oncogenic pathway provides new insights into the potential mechanisms of RCC oncogenesis and metastasis.},

Because visual behaviors are complex in nature, it can be difficult to make comparisons and conclusions based on subjects' scanpaths. In this study, we analyze visual activities from 15 expert radiographers and 26 novices as they view a series of images to attempt to discover relationships between a large number of features including fixation, region and subject information. We expect that the techniques used in this study will be useful in finding common behaviors in eye tracking data for medical applications.

Gene expression is regulated by interactions between transcription factors (TFs) and specific regulatory elements in the promoter regions of target genes. Thus, it is important to decipher and analyze TFs that bind to regulatory regions of diseased genes and regulate their expression. In the present study, computational methods involving the combination of gene expression data from microarray experiments and promoter sequence analysis of a curated gene set involved in the cervical cancer causation have been utilized for identifying potential regulatory elements. Consensus predictions of two approaches led to the identification of twelve TFs that might be crucial to the regulation of cervical cancer progression. Subsequently, TF enrichment and oncomine expression analysis suggested that the transcription factor family E2F played an important role for the regulation of genes involve in cervical carcinogenesis. Our results suggest that E2F possesses diagnostic/prognostic value and can act as a potential drug target in cervical cancer.},

abstract = {Recent technical developments have enabled the transcriptomes of hundreds of cells to be assayed in an unbiased manner, opening up the possibility that new subpopulations of cells can be found. However, the effects of potential confounding factors, such as the cell cycle, on the heterogeneity of gene expression and therefore on the ability to robustly identify subpopulations remain unclear. We present and validate a computational approach that uses latent variable models to account for such hidden factors. We show that our single-cell latent variable model (scLVM) allows the identification of otherwise undetectable subpopulations of cells that correspond to different stages during the differentiation of naive T cells into T helper 2 cells. Our approach can be used not only to identify cellular subpopulations but also to tease apart different sources of gene expression heterogeneity in single-cell transcriptomes.},

abstract = {Whether an object captures our attention depends on its bottom-up salience, that is, how different it is compared with its neighbors, and top-down control, that is, our current inner goals. At which neuronal stage they interact to guide behavior is still unknown. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging study, we found evidence for a hierarchy of saliency maps in human early visual cortex (V1 to hV4) and identified where bottom-up saliency interacts with top-down control: V1 represented pure bottom-up signals, V2 was only responsive to top-down modulations, and in hV4 bottom-up saliency and top-down control converged. Two distinct cerebral networks exerted top-down control: distractor suppression engaged the left intraparietal sulcus, while target enhancement involved the frontal eye field and lateral occipital cortex. Hence, attentional selection is implemented in integrated maps in visual cortex, which provide precise topographic information about target-distractor locations thus allowing for successful visual search.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Rescue of patients who fail to be cured after 2 or 3 chemotherapy combinations (including high-dose chemotherapy [HDCT]) or whose disease is refractory to cisplatin is still an unmet need. We assessed the efficacy of a triple-combination chemotherapy in the salvage setting, beyond second-line regimens.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed institutional data on consecutive patients who received paclitaxel 80 mg/m(2) intravenously (IV), cisplatin 50 mg/m(2) IV, and gemcitabine 800 mg/m(2) IV on days 1 and 8 every 3 weeks for a maximum of 8 administrations, followed by surgery. Response, survival (progression-free survival [PFS] and overall survival [OS]), and safety/toxicity outcomes were the end points. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for survival estimates, and multiple Cox regression models were used to analyze the prognostic factors.

RESULTS: Seventy-five patients were treated from April 1999 to July 2011. Eight complete responses (CR, 10.7{\%}), 29 partial responses with normal markers (PRm(-), 38.7{\%}), and 13 cases of incomplete response/stable disease were recorded, for a major response rate (CR + PRm(-)) of 49{\%}. Thirty-three patients (44{\%}) underwent surgery, which was radical in 14 cases (42.4{\%}). Two-year PFS was 14.8{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval [CI], 8.5{\%}-25.8{\%}), whereas 2-year OS was 29.5{\%} (95{\%} CI, 20.3{\%}-42.7{\%}). Five-year OS in disease-free patients (no evidence of disease) was 60.3{\%} (95{\%} CI, 42.2{\%}-86.2{\%}), and median OS between patients with and without evidence of disease was significantly different (71 [interquartile range {\{}IQR{\}}, 14-116] vs. 12.5 [IQR, 8-19] months with a 6-month landmark analysis; P = .0019).

CONCLUSION: TPG is an effective combination, and best results were achieved if a radical clearance of residual disease could be accomplished. A randomized comparison with dose-intensified regimens is advisable.},

abstract = {What distinguishes the locations that we fixate from those that we do not? To answer this question we recorded eye movements while observers viewed natural scenes, and recorded image characteristics centred at the locations that observers fixated. To investigate potential differences in the visual characteristics of fixated versus non-fixated locations, these images were transformed to make intensity, contrast, colour, and edge content explicit. Signal detection and information theoretic techniques were then used to compare fixated regions to those that were not. The presence of contrast and edge information was more strongly discriminatory than luminance or chromaticity. Fixated locations tended to be more distinctive in the high spatial frequencies. Extremes of low frequency luminance information were avoided. With prolonged viewing, consistency in fixation locations between observers decreased. In contrast to [Parkhurst, D. J., Law, K., {\&} Niebur, E. (2002). Modeling the role of salience in the allocation of overt visual attention. Vision Research, 42 (1), 107-123] we found no change in the involvement of image features over time. We attribute this difference in our results to a systematic bias in their metric. We propose that saccade target selection involves an unchanging intermediate level representation of the scene but that the high-level interpretation of this representation changes over time. ?? 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Telepathology, the practice of pathology at a long distance, has advanced continuously since 1986. Today, fourth-generation telepathology systems, so-called virtual slide telepathology systems, are being used for education applications. Both conventional and innovative surgical pathology diagnostic services are being designed and implemented as well. The technology has been commercialized by more than 30 companies in Asia, the United States, and Europe. Early adopters of telepathology have been laboratories with special challenges in providing anatomic pathology services, ranging from the need to provide anatomic pathology services at great distances to the use of the technology to increase efficiency of services between hospitals less than a mile apart. As to what often happens in medicine, early adopters of new technologies are professionals who create model programs that are successful and then stimulate the creation of infrastructure (ie, reimbursement, telecommunications, information technologies, and so on) that forms the platforms for entry of later, mainstream, adopters. The trend at medical schools, in the United States, is to go entirely digital for their pathology courses, discarding their student light microscopes, and building virtual slide laboratories. This may create a generation of pathology trainees who prefer digital pathology imaging over the traditional hands-on light microscopy. The creation of standards for virtual slide telepathology is early in its development but accelerating. The field of telepathology has now reached a tipping point at which major corporations now investing in the technology will insist that standards be created for pathology digital imaging as a value added business proposition. A key to success in teleradiology, already a growth industry, has been the implementation of standards for digital radiology imaging. Telepathology is already the enabling technology for new, innovative laboratory services. Examples include STAT QA surgical pathology second opinions at a distance and a telehealth-enabled rapid breast care service. The innovative bundling of telemammography, telepathology, and teleoncology services may represent a new paradigm in breast care that helps address the serious issue of fragmentation of breast cancer care in the United States and elsewhere. Legal and regulatory issues in telepathology are being addressed and are regarded as a potential catalyst for the next wave of telepathology advances, applications, and implementations. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Genetic risk scores have been developed for coronary artery disease and atherosclerosis, but are not predictive of adverse cardiovascular events. We asked whether peripheral blood expression profiles may be predictive of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and/or cardiovascular death.

METHODS: Peripheral blood samples from 338 subjects aged 62 ± 11 years with coronary artery disease (CAD) were analyzed in two phases (discovery N = 175, and replication N = 163), and followed for a mean 2.4 years for cardiovascular death. Gene expression was measured on Illumina HT-12 microarrays with two different normalization procedures to control technical and biological covariates. Whole genome genotyping was used to support comparative genome-wide association studies of gene expression. Analysis of variance was combined with receiver operating curve and survival analysis to define a transcriptional signature of cardiovascular death.

RESULTS: In both phases, there was significant differential expression between healthy and AMI groups with overall down-regulation of genes involved in T-lymphocyte signaling and up-regulation of inflammatory genes. Expression quantitative trait loci analysis provided evidence for altered local genetic regulation of transcript abundance in AMI samples. On follow-up there were 31 cardiovascular deaths. A principal component (PC1) score capturing covariance of 238 genes that were differentially expressed between deceased and survivors in the discovery phase significantly predicted risk of cardiovascular death in the replication and combined samples (hazard ratio = 8.5, P {\textless} 0.0001) and improved the C-statistic (area under the curve 0.82 to 0.91, P = 0.03) after adjustment for traditional covariates.

CONCLUSIONS: A specific blood gene expression profile is associated with a significant risk of death in Caucasian subjects with CAD. This comprises a subset of transcripts that are also altered in expression during acute myocardial infarction.},

abstract = {Macromolecular interactions (i.e. protein-protein or DNA/RNA-protein interactions) play important cellular roles, including cellular communication and programmed cell death. Small-molecule chemical probes are crucial for dissecting these highly organized interactions, for mapping their function at the molecular level and developing new therapeutics. The lack of ideal chemical probes required to understand macromolecular interactions is the missing link in the next step of dissecting such interactions. Unfortunately, the classical combinatorial-chemistry community has not successfully provided the required probes (i.e. natural product inspired chemical probes that are rich in stereochemical and three-dimensional structural diversity) to achieve these goals. The emerging area of diversity-oriented synthesis (DOS) is beginning to provide natural product-like chemical probes that may be useful in this arena.},

abstract = {Whole-genome association studies (WGAS) bring new computational, as well as analytic, challenges to researchers. Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK, large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification, association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based linkage analysis.},

We explored how aging affects transcriptional dynamics using single-cell RNA sequencing of unstimulated and stimulated na{\"{i}}ve and effector memory CD4+ T cells from young and old mice from two divergent species. In young animals, immunological activation drives a conserved transcriptomic switch, resulting in tightly controlled gene expression characterized by a strong up-regulation of a core activation program, coupled with a decrease in cell-to-cell variability. Aging perturbed the activation of this core program and increased expression heterogeneity across populations of cells in both species. These discoveries suggest that increased cell-to-cell transcriptional variability will be a hallmark feature of aging across most, if not all, mammalian tissues.},

abstract = {Text mining is a flexible technology that can be applied to numerous different tasks in biology and medicine. We present a system for extracting disease-gene associations from biomedical abstracts. The system consists of a highly efficient dictionary-based tagger for named entity recognition of human genes and diseases, which we combine with a scoring scheme that takes into account co-occurrences both within and between sentences. We show that this approach is able to extract half of all manually curated associations with a false positive rate of only 0.16{\%}. Nonetheless, text mining should not stand alone, but be combined with other types of evidence. For this reason, we have developed the DISEASES resource, which integrates the results from text mining with manually curated disease-gene associations, cancer mutation data, and genome-wide association studies from existing databases. The DISEASES resource is accessible through a web interface at http://diseases.jensenlab.org/, where the text-mining software and all associations are also freely available for download.},

abstract = {Technology for acquisition of virtual slides was developed in 1985; however, it was not until the late 1990s that desktop computers had enough processing speed to commercialize virtual microscopy and apply the technology to education. By 2000, the progressive decrease in use of traditional microscopy in medical student education had set the stage for the entry of virtual microscopy into medical schools. Since that time, it has been successfully implemented into many pathology courses in the United States and around the world, with surveys indicating that about 50{\%} of pathology courses already have or expect to implement virtual microscopy. Over the last decade, in addition to an increasing ability to emulate traditional microscopy, virtual microscopy has allowed educators to take advantage of the accessibility, efficiency, and pedagogic versatility of the computer and the Internet. The cost of virtual microscopy in education is now quite reasonable after taking into account replacement cost for microscopes, maintenance of glass slides, and the fact that 1-dimensional microscope space can be converted to multiuse computer laboratories or research. Although the current technology for implementation of virtual microscopy in histopathology education is very good, it could be further improved upon by better low-power screen resolution and depth of field. Nevertheless, virtual microscopy is beginning to play an increasing role in continuing education, house staff education, and evaluation of competency in histopathology. As Z-axis viewing (focusing) becomes more efficient, virtual microscopy will also become integrated into education in cytology, hematology, microbiology, and urinalysis. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {The Markov Chain Monte Carlo method is the dominant paradigm for posterior computation in Bayesian analysis. It is common to control computation time by making approximations to the Markov transition kernel. Comparatively little attention has been paid to computational optimality in these approximating Markov Chains, or when such approximations are justified relative to obtaining shorter paths from the exact kernel. We give simple, sharp bounds for uniform approximations of uniformly mixing Markov chains. We then suggest a notion of optimality that incorporates computation time and approximation error, and use our bounds to make generalizations about properties of good approximations in the uniformly mixing setting. The relevance of these properties is demonstrated in applications to a minibatching-based approximate MCMC algorithm for large {\$}n{\$} logistic regression and low-rank approximations for Gaussian processes.},

However, cursor interactions are not all the same; different types of cursor behavior patterns exist, such as reading, hesitating, scrolling and clicking, each of which has a different meaning. We conduct a search study with 36 subjects and 32 search tasks to determine when gaze and cursor are aligned, and thus when the cursor position is a good proxy for gaze position. We study the effect of time, behavior patterns, user, and search task on the gaze-cursor alignment, ﬁndings which lead us to question the maxim that “gaze is well approximated by cursor.” These lessons inform an experiment in which we predict the gaze position with better accuracy than simply using the cursor position, improving the state-of-the-art technique for approximating visual attention with the cursor. Our new technique can help make better use of large-scale cursor data in identifying how users examine Web search pages.},

abstract = {Pediatric lymphoid leukemia has the highest cure rate of all pediatric malignancies, yet due to its prevalence, still accounts for the majority of childhood cancer deaths and requires long-term highly toxic therapy. The ability to target B-cell ALL with immunoglobulin-like binders, whether anti-CD22 antibody or anti-CD19 CAR-Ts, has impacted treatment options for some patients. The development of new ways to target B-cell antigens continues at rapid pace. T-cell ALL accounts for up to 20{\%} of childhood leukemia but has yet to see a set of high-value immunotherapeutic targets identified. To find new targets for T-ALL immunotherapy, we employed a bioinformatic comparison to broad normal tissue arrays, hematopoietic stem cells (HSC), and mature lymphocytes, then filtered the results for transcripts encoding plasma membrane proteins. T-ALL bears a core T-cell signature and transcripts encoding TCR/CD3 components and canonical markers of T-cell development predominate, especially when comparison was made to normal tissue or HSC. However, when comparison to mature lymphocytes was also undertaken, we identified two antigens that may drive, or be associated with leukemogenesis; TALLA-1 and hedgehog interacting protein. In addition, TCR subfamilies, CD1, activation and adhesion markers, membrane-organizing molecules, and receptors linked to metabolism and inflammation were also identified. Of these, only CD52, CD37, and CD98 are currently being targeted clinically. This work provides a set of targets to be considered for future development of immunotherapies for T-ALL.},

@article{Schroeder2006,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: The integrity of RNA molecules is of paramount importance for experiments that try to reflect the snapshot of gene expression at the moment of RNA extraction. Until recently, there has been no reliable standard for estimating the integrity of RNA samples and the ratio of 28S:18S ribosomal RNA, the common measure for this purpose, has been shown to be inconsistent. The advent of microcapillary electrophoretic RNA separation provides the basis for an automated high-throughput approach, in order to estimate the integrity of RNA samples in an unambiguous way. METHODS: A method is introduced that automatically selects features from signal measurements and constructs regression models based on a Bayesian learning technique. Feature spaces of different dimensionality are compared in the Bayesian framework, which allows selecting a final feature combination corresponding to models with high posterior probability. RESULTS: This approach is applied to a large collection of electrophoretic RNA measurements recorded with an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer to extract an algorithm that describes RNA integrity. The resulting algorithm is a user-independent, automated and reliable procedure for standardization of RNA quality control that allows the calculation of an RNA integrity number (RIN). CONCLUSION: Our results show the importance of taking characteristics of several regions of the recorded electropherogram into account in order to get a robust and reliable prediction of RNA integrity, especially if compared to traditional methods.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Gene expression data exhibit common information over the genome. This article shows how data can be analysed from an efficient whole-genome perspective. Further, the methods have been developed so that users with limited expertise in bioinformatics and statistical computing techniques could use and modify this procedure to their own needs. The method outlined first uses a large-scale linear mixed model for the expression data genome-wide, and then uses finite mixture models to separate differentially expressed (DE) from non-DE transcripts. These methods are illustrated through application to an exceptional UK Brain Expression Consortium involving 12 human frozen post-mortem brain regions.

RESULTS: Fitting linear mixed models has allowed variation in gene expression between different biological states (e.g. brain regions, gender, age) to be investigated. The model can be extended to allow for differing levels of variation between different biological states. Predicted values of the random effects show the effects of each transcript in a particular biological state. Using the UK Brain Expression Consortium data, this approach yielded striking patterns of co-regional gene expression. Fitting the finite mixture model to the effects within each state provides a convenient method to filter transcripts that are DE: these DE transcripts can then be extracted for advanced functional analysis.

AVAILABILITY: The data for all regions except HYPO and SPCO are available at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) site, accession number GSE46706. R code for the analysis is available in the Supplementary file.},

abstract = {Alternative pre-mRNA splicing (AS) widely expands proteome diversity through the combinatorial assembly of exons. The analysis of AS on a large scale, by using splice-sensitive microarrays, is a highly efficient method to detect the majority of known and predicted alternative transcripts for a given gene. The response to targeted anticancer therapies cannot easily be anticipated without prior knowledge of the expression, by the tumor, of target proteins or genes. To analyze, in depth, transcript structure and levels for genes involved in these responses, including AKT1-3, HER1-4, HIF1A, PIK3CA, PIK3R1-2, VEGFA-D and PIR, we engineered a dedicated gene chip with coverage of an average 185 probes per gene and, especially, exon-exon junction probes. As a proof of concept, we demonstrated the ability of such a chip to detect the effects of over-expressed SRSF2 RNA binding protein on the structure and abundance of mRNA products in H358 lung cancer cells conditionally over-expressing SRSF2. Major splicing changes were observed, including in HER1/EGFR pre-mRNA, which were also seen in human lung cancer samples over-expressing the SRSF2 protein. In addition, we showed that variations in HER1/EGFR pre-mRNA splicing triggered by SRSF2 overexpression in H358 cells resulted in a drop in HER1/EGFR protein level, which correlated with increased sensitivity to gefitinib, an EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor. We propose, therefore, that this novel tool could be especially relevant for clinical applications, with the aim to predict the response before treatment.},

abstract = {Mammalian pre-implantation development is a complex process involving dramatic changes in the transcriptional architecture. We report here a comprehensive analysis of transcriptome dynamics from oocyte to morula in both human and mouse embryos, using single-cell RNA sequencing. Based on single-nucleotide variants in human blastomere messenger RNAs and paternal-specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms, we identify novel stage-specific monoallelic expression patterns for a significant portion of polymorphic gene transcripts (25 to 53{\%}). By weighted gene co-expression network analysis, we find that each developmental stage can be delineated concisely by a small number of functional modules of co-expressed genes. This result indicates a sequential order of transcriptional changes in pathways of cell cycle, gene regulation, translation and metabolism, acting in a step-wise fashion from cleavage to morula. Cross-species comparisons with mouse pre-implantation embryos reveal that the majority of human stage-specific modules (7 out of 9) are notably preserved, but developmental specificity and timing differ between human and mouse. Furthermore, we identify conserved key members (or hub genes) of the human and mouse networks. These genes represent novel candidates that are likely to be key in driving mammalian pre-implantation development. Together, the results provide a valuable resource to dissect gene regulatory mechanisms underlying progressive development of early mammalian embryos.},

abstract = {Dietary factors may affect risk of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In an ongoing case-control study of RCC initiated in Houston, Texas, in 2002, we identified 3 empirically derived dietary patterns: "fruits and vegetables," "American/Western," and "Tex-Mex." Among 659 RCC cases and 699 controls, we evaluated associations of these dietary patterns with RCC risk and whether the associations varied by obesity status, smoking status, physical activity level, history of hypertension, and genetic variants previously identified via genome-wide association studies. Among persons in the highest categories of adherence versus the lowest, the "fruits and vegetables" dietary pattern was associated with an approximately 50{\%} lower RCC risk (Ptrend {\textless} 0.001), while "American/Western" dietary pattern scores were positively associated with a 2-fold higher risk (Ptrend {\textless} 0.001). We observed synergistic interaction between the American/Western pattern and hypertension status: The odds ratio (highest tertile vs. lowest) among persons with hypertension was 2.23 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.43, 3.45), as compared with 1.76 (95{\%} confidence interval: 1.16, 2.70) among persons without hypertension (additive Pinteraction = 0.01). A variant (rs718314) in the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, type 2 gene (ITPR2) was found to interact with the American/Western dietary pattern in relation to RCC risk (additive Pinteraction = 0.03). ITPR2 has been shown to affect nutrient metabolism and central obesity. Dietary patterns, genetic variants, and host characteristics may individually and jointly influence susceptibility to RCC.},

abstract = {Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common pathological subtype of kidney cancer. Here, we integrated an unbiased genome-wide RNA interference screen for ccRCC survival regulators with an analysis of recurrently overexpressed genes in ccRCC to identify new therapeutic targets in this disease. One of the most potent survival regulators, the monocarboxylate transporter MCT4 (SLC16A3), impaired ccRCC viability in all eight ccRCC lines tested and was the seventh most overexpressed gene in a meta-analysis of five ccRCC expression datasets. MCT4 silencing impaired secretion of lactate generated through glycolysis and induced cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Silencing MCT4 resulted in intracellular acidosis, and reduction in intracellular ATP production together with partial reversion of the Warburg effect in ccRCC cell lines. Intra-tumoural heterogeneity in the intensity of MCT4 protein expression was observed in primary ccRCCs. MCT4 protein expression analysis based on the highest intensity of expression in primary ccRCCs was associated with poorer relapse-free survival, whereas modal intensity correlated with Fuhrman nuclear grade. Consistent with the potential selection of subclones enriched for MCT4 expression during disease progression, MCT4 expression was greater at sites of metastatic disease. These data suggest that MCT4 may serve as a novel metabolic target to reverse the Warburg effect and limit disease progression in ccRCC.},

abstract = {CONTEXT: Genomic regions without protein-coding potential give rise to millions of protein-noncoding RNA transcripts (noncoding RNA) that participate in virtually all cellular processes. Research over the last 10 yr has accumulated evidence that long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are often altered in human urologic cancers. OBJECTIVE: To review current progress in the biology and implication of lncRNAs associated with prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer. EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: The PubMed database was searched for articles in the English language with combinations of the Medical Subject Headings terms long non coding RNA, long noncoding RNA, long untranslated RNA, cancer, neoplasms, prostate, bladder, and kidney. EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We summarise existing knowledge on the systematics, biology, and function of lncRNAs, particularly these involved in prostate, kidney, and bladder cancer. We also discuss the possible utilisation of lncRNAs as novel biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in urologic malignancies and portray the major challenges and future perspectives of ongoing lncRNA research. CONCLUSIONS: LncRNAs are important regulators of gene expression interacting with the major pathways of cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, and survival. Alterations in the function of lncRNAs promote tumour formation, progression, and metastasis of prostate, bladder, and kidney cancer. LncRNAs can be used as noninvasive tumour markers in urologic malignancies. Increased knowledge of the molecular mechanisms by which lncRNAs perform their function in the normal and malignant cell will lead to a better understanding of tumour biology and could provide novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of urologic cancers. PATIENT SUMMARY: In this paper we reviewed current knowledge of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) for the detection and treatment of urologic cancers.

abstract = {Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) constitutes the most common type of lung cancer and is frequently diagnosed at advanced stages. Clinical studies have shown that molecular targeted therapies increase survival and improve quality of life in patients. Nevertheless, the realization of personalized therapies for NSCLC faces a number of challenges including the integration of clinical and genetic data and a lack of clinical decision support tools to assist physicians with patient selection. To address this problem, we used frequent pattern mining to establish the relationships of patient characteristics and tumor response in advanced NSCLC. Univariate analysis determined that smoking status, histology, EGFR mutation, and targeted drug were significantly associated with response to targeted therapy. We applied four classifiers to predict treatment outcome from EGFR-TKIs. Overall, the highest classification accuracy was 76.56{\%} and the AUC was 0.76. The decision tree used a combination of EGFR mutations, histology, and smoking status to predict tumor response and the output was both easily understandable and in keeping with current knowledge. Our findings suggest that support vector machines and decision trees are a promising approach for clinical decision support in the patient selection for targeted therapy in advanced NSCLC.},

abstract = {Wilms' tumors have characteristic chromosomal abnormalities, such as the 11p13 deletion, in a subset of cases. This is one of the very few reports comparing single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array analysis with conventional karyotyping of Wilms' tumors. A total of 43 frozen tumor samples were analyzed using the Affymetrix Cytogenetics Whole-Genome 2.7M array. The findings from the SNP array analysis were then compared with those from conventional karyotyping. A comparison between SNP array and conventional karyotype findings was possible in 38 of 43 specimens (88.4{\%}). The SNP array and classic cytogenetic results were concordant in 33 of 38 specimens (87{\%}). SNP array analysis was able to support the findings of classic cytogenetics. The SNP array detected regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) in 41 of 43 (95{\%}) specimens. However, it did not detect balanced translocations and inversions that were observed by conventional cytogenetics. Our results show that the data generated from these platforms are complementary. The SNP array also detected additional gains and losses as well as regions of LOH with associated disomy, which are likely to represent segmental uniparental disomy. The observed discrepancies can be explained by the inherent limitations of each technique.},

@article{Witwer2013,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Public sharing of scientific data has assumed greater importance in the omics era. Transparency is necessary for confirmation and validation, and multiple examiners aid in extracting maximal value from large data sets. Accordingly, database submission and provision of the Minimum Information About a Microarray Experiment (MIAME)(3) are required by most journals as a prerequisite for review or acceptance.

METHODS: In this study, the level of data submission and MIAME compliance was reviewed for 127 articles that included microarray-based microRNA (miRNA) profiling and were published from July 2011 through April 2012 in the journals that published the largest number of such articles--PLOS ONE, the Journal of Biological Chemistry, Blood, and Oncogene--along with articles from 9 other journals, including Clinical Chemistry, that published smaller numbers of array-based articles.

RESULTS: Overall, data submission was reported at publication for {\textless}40{\%} of all articles, and almost 75{\%} of articles were MIAME noncompliant. On average, articles that included full data submission scored significantly higher on a quality metric than articles with limited or no data submission, and studies with adequate description of methods disproportionately included larger numbers of experimental repeats. Finally, for several articles that were not MIAME compliant, data reanalysis revealed less than complete support for the published conclusions, in 1 case leading to retraction.

CONCLUSIONS: These findings buttress the hypothesis that reluctance to share data is associated with low study quality and suggest that most miRNA array investigations are underpowered and/or potentially compromised by a lack of appropriate reporting and data submission.},

Mouse neuroblastoma Neuro2a cells and, more recently, C2C12 myocytes and myotubes have emerged as popular models for investigating the cellular biology of PrP. Mouse epithelial NMuMG cells might become attractive models for studying the possible involvement of PrP in a morphogenetic program underlying epithelial-to-mesenchymal transitions. Here we describe the generation of PrP knockout clones from these cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9 knockout technology. More specifically, knockout clones were generated with two separate guide RNAs targeting recognition sites on opposite strands within the first hundred nucleotides of the Prnp coding sequence. Several PrP knockout clones were isolated and genomic insertions and deletions near the CRISPR-target sites were characterized. Subsequently, deep quantitative global proteome analyses that recorded the relative abundance of{\textgreater}3000 proteins (data deposited to ProteomeXchange Consortium) were undertaken to begin to characterize the molecular consequences of PrP deficiency. The levels of ∼120 proteins were shown to reproducibly correlate with the presence or absence of PrP, with most of these proteins belonging to extracellular components, cell junctions or the cytoskeleton.},

abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in populations of European ancestry have identified four susceptibility loci. No GWAS has been conducted among African Americans (AA), who experience a higher incidence of RCC. We conducted a GWAS in which we analyzed 1,136,723 common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) among 255 cases and 375 controls of African ancestry, and further investigated 16 SNPs in a replication set (140 cases and 543 controls). The 12p11.23 variant rs10771279, located 77 kb from the European-ancestry RCC marker rs718314, was associated with RCC risk in the GWAS (P = 1.2 × 10(-7)) but did not replicate (P = 0.99). Consistent with European-ancestry findings, the A allele of rs7105934 on 11q13.3 was associated with decreased risk [OR, 0.76, 95{\%} confidence interval (CI), 0.64-0.91; P = 0.0022]. The frequency of this allele was higher than that observed in the European-ancestry GWAS (0.56 and 0.07, respectively, among controls). The rs7105934 association was stronger for clear cell RCC (ccRCC: OR, 0.56; P = 7.4 × 10(-7)) and absent for cases of other or unknown histology (OR, 1.02; P = 0.86). Analyses of rs7105934 by subtype among European-ancestry participants from these studies yielded similar findings (ORs 0.69 and 0.92, respectively). This study provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence that rs7105934 is an RCC susceptibility locus among AAs. Our finding that the association with this SNP may be specific to clear-cell RCC is novel and requires additional investigation. Additional investigation of rs10771279 and other suggestive GWAS findings is also needed.},

abstract = {A pilot study examined the extent to which eye movements occurring during interpretation of digitized breast biopsy whole slide images (WSI) can distinguish novice interpreters from experts, informing assessments of competency progression during training and across the physician-learning continuum. A pathologist with fellowship training in breast pathology interpreted digital WSI of breast tissue and marked the region of highest diagnostic relevance (dROI). These same images were then evaluated using computer vision techniques to identify visually salient regions of interest (vROI) without diagnostic relevance. A non-invasive eye tracking system recorded pathologists' (N = 7) visual behavior during image interpretation, and we measured differential viewing of vROIs versus dROIs according to their level of expertise. Pathologists with relatively low expertise in interpreting breast pathology were more likely to fixate on, and subsequently return to, diagnostically irrelevant vROIs relative to experts. Repeatedly fixating on the distracting vROI showed limited value in predicting diagnostic failure. These preliminary results suggest that eye movements occurring during digital slide interpretation can characterize expertise development by demonstrating differential attraction to diagnostically relevant versus visually distracting image regions. These results carry both theoretical implications and potential for monitoring and evaluating student progress and providing automated feedback and scanning guidance in educational settings.},

The different steps of this protocol are illustrated on a real-life data application for Alzheimer's disease (AD) (2259 patients and 6017 controls from France). Particularly, in the exhaustive genome-wide epistasis screening we identified AD-associated interacting SNPs-pair from chromosome 6q11.1 (rs6455128, the KHDRBS2 gene) and 13q12.11 (rs7989332, the CRYL1 gene) (p = 0.006, corrected for multiple testing). A replication analysis in the independent AD cohort from Germany (555 patients and 824 controls) confirmed the discovered epistasis signal (p = 0.036). This signal was also supported by a meta-analysis approach in 5 independent AD cohorts that was applied in the context of epistasis for the first time. Transcriptome analysis revealed negative correlation between expression levels of KHDRBS2 and CRYL1 in both the temporal cortex ($\beta$ = -0.19, p = 0.0006) and cerebellum ($\beta$ = -0.23, p {\textless} 0.0001) brain regions.

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The phenome represents a distinct set of information in the human population. It has been explored particularly in its relationship with the genome to identify correlations for diseases. The phenome has been also explored for drug repositioning with efforts focusing on the search space for the most similar candidate drugs. For a comprehensive analysis of the phenome, we assumed that all phenotypes (indications and side effects) were inter-connected with a probabilistic distribution and this characteristic may offer an opportunity to identify new therapeutic indications for a given drug. Correspondingly, we employed Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), which introduces latent variables (topics) to govern the phenome distribution.

RESULTS: We developed our model on the phenome information in Side Effect Resource (SIDER). We first developed a LDA model optimized based on its recovery potential through perturbing the drug-phenotype matrix for each of the drug-indication pairs where each drug-indication relationship was switched to "unknown" one at the time and then recovered based on the remaining drug-phenotype pairs. Of the probabilistically significant pairs, 70{\%} was successfully recovered. Next, we applied the model on the whole phenome to narrow down repositioning candidates and suggest alternative indications. We were able to retrieve approved indications of 6 drugs whose indications were not listed in SIDER. For 908 drugs that were present with their indication information, our model suggested alternative treatment options for further investigations. Several of the suggested new uses can be supported with information from the scientific literature.

CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrated that the phenome can be further analyzed by a generative model, which can discover probabilistic associations between drugs and therapeutic uses. In this regard, LDA serves as an enrichment tool to explore new uses of existing drugs by narrowing down the search space.},

abstract = {Virtual slides are high-magnification digital images of tissue sections, stored in a multi-resolution file format. Using appropriate software, these slides can be viewed in a web browser in a manner that closely simulates examination of glass slides with a real microscope. We describe the successful implementation of teaching microscopic pathology with virtual slides and, for the first time, their use in summative assessment. Both students and teaching staff readily adapted to the use of virtual microscopy. Questionnaire feedback from students strongly indicated that virtual slides solved a number of problems in their learning, while providing good to excellent image quality. A deliberate policy of allocating two students per workstation promoted collaboration and helped to maintain interest in microscopic pathology. The use of a secure browser facilitated assessment using virtual slides, with no technical or security issues arising despite high peak demand. The new Medicine programme at the University of New South Wales will exclusively utilize virtual microscopy for the study of both histology and histopathology. We believe that the use of high-quality learning resources such as virtual slides can ensure that microscopic examination of tissues remains both meaningful and interesting.},

abstract = {Purpose To identify and compare key stages of the visual process in experienced and inexperienced readers and to examine how these processes are used to search a moving three-dimensional (3D) image and their relationship to false-negative errors. Materials and Methods Institutional review board research ethics approval was granted to use anonymized computed tomographic (CT) colonographic data from previous studies and to obtain eye-tracking data from volunteers. Sixty-five radiologists (27 experienced, 38 inexperienced) interpreted 23 endoluminal 3D CT colonographic videos. Eye movements were recorded by using eye tracking with a desk-mounted tracker. Readers indicated when they saw a polyp by clicking a computer mouse. Polyp location and boundary on each video frame were quantified and gaze data were related to the polyp boundary for each individual reader and case. Predefined metrics were quantified and used to describe and compare visual search patterns between experienced and inexperienced readers by using multilevel modeling. Results Time to first pursuit was significantly shorter in experienced readers (hazard ratio, 1.22 [95{\%} confidence interval: 1.04, 1.44]; P = .017) but other metrics were not significantly different. Regardless of expertise, metrics such as assessment, identification period, and pursuit times were extended in videos where polyps were visible on screen for longer periods of time. In 97{\%} (760 of 787) of observations, readers correctly pursued polyps. Conclusion Experienced readers had shorter time to first eye pursuit, but many other characteristics of eye tracking were similar between experienced and inexperienced readers. Readers pursued polyps in 97{\%} of observations, which indicated that errors during interpretation of 3D CT colonography in this study occurred in either the discovery or the recognition phase, but rarely in the scanning phase of radiologic image inspection. {\textcopyright} RSNA, 2014.},

Recently, healthcare researchers have started to show interest in using eye-tracking techniques to study medical decision-making. Mapping the literature pertaining to eye tracking using a systematic approach is valuable at this point to bring together all the studies to date on how medical decision-makers make decisions, and the results may contribute to clinical training. This review follows Arksey and O'Malley's scoping review framework to improve our understanding of visual cue processing in medical decision-making. A diverse range of studies was identified, and the results are presented descriptively to develop a more coherent understanding of different aspects of cue processing and errors in medical decision-making. The review shows the need for more extensive investigations of cue processing and medical decision-making.},

abstract = {A biologically motivated computational model of bottom-up visual selective attention was used to examine the degree to which stimulus salience guides the allocation of attention. Human eye movements were recorded while participants viewed a series of digitized images of complex natural and artificial scenes. Stimulus dependence of attention, as measured by the correlation between computed stimulus salience and fixation locations, was found to be significantly greater than that expected by chance alone and furthermore was greatest for eye movements that immediately follow stimulus onset. The ability to guide attention of three modeled stimulus features (color, intensity and orientation) was examined and found to vary with image type. Additionally, the effect of the drop in visual sensitivity as a function of eccentricity on stimulus salience was examined, modeled, and shown to be an important determiner of attentional allocation. Overall, the results indicate that stimulus-driven, bottom-up mechanisms contribute significantly to attentional guidance under natural viewing conditions. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To report the genome-wide significant and/or replicable risk variants for alcohol dependence and explore their potential biological functions.

METHODS: We searched in PubMed for all genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of alcohol dependence. The following three types of the results were extracted: genome-wide significant associations in an individual sample, the combined samples, or the meta-analysis (p {\textless} 5 × 10(-8) ); top-ranked associations in an individual sample (p {\textless} 10(-5) ) that were nominally replicated in other samples (p {\textless} .05); and nominally replicable associations across at least three independent GWAS samples (p {\textless} .05). These results were meta-analyzed. cis-eQTLs in human, RNA expression in rat and mouse brains and bioinformatics properties of all of these risk variants were analyzed.

RESULTS: The variants located within the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) cluster were significantly associated with alcohol dependence at the genome-wide level (p {\textless} 5 × 10(-8) ) in at least one sample. Some associations with the ADH cluster were replicable across six independent GWAS samples. The variants located within or near SERINC2, KIAA0040, MREG-PECR or PKNOX2 were significantly associated with alcohol dependence at the genome-wide level (p {\textless} 5 × 10(-8) ) in meta-analysis or combined samples, and these associations were replicable across at least one sample. The associations with the variants within NRD1, GPD1L-CMTM8 or MAP3K9-PCNX were suggestive (5 × 10(-8)  {\textless} p {\textless} 10(-5) ) in some samples, and nominally replicable in other samples. The associations with the variants at HTR7 and OPA3 were nominally replicable across at least three independent GWAS samples (10(-5)  {\textless} p {\textless} .05). Some risk variants at the ADH cluster, SERINC2, KIAA0040, NRD1, and HTR7 had potential biological functions.

CONCLUSION: The most robust risk locus was the ADH cluster. SERINC2, KIAA0040, NRD1, and HTR7 were also likely to play important roles in alcohol dependence. PKNOX2, MREG, PECR, GPD1L, CMTM8, MAP3K9, PCNX, and OPA3 might play less important roles in risk for alcohol dependence based on the function analysis. This conclusion will significantly contribute to the post-GWAS follow-up studies on alcohol dependence.},

abstract = {Digital Breast Tomosynthesis has several advantages over traditional 2D mammography. However, the cost-effectiveness to implement DBT modality into breast screening programmes is still under investigation. The DBT modality has been integrated into a regional breast screening program in Italy for several years. The purpose of this study is to examine the experienced Italian DBT readers' visual search behaviour and summarise their visual inspection patterns. Seven experienced radiologists took part in the study, reading a set of DBT cases with a mixture of both normal and abnormal cases whilst their eye movements data were recorded. They read the cases through a fixed procedure starting with a 2D overview and then went through the DBT view of each side of the breasts. It was found that the experienced readers tended to perform a global-focal scan over the 2D view to detect the abnormality and then ‘drilled' through the DBT slices, interpreting the details of the feature. The reading speed was also investigated to see if there was any difference in length of time when expert radiologists examine both normal and abnormal cases. The results showed that there was no significant difference in time between normal and abnormal cases. The eye movement patterns revealed that experienced DBT readers covered more areas on the 2D view and fixated longer and with more dwells inside the AOI in the 3D view. Based on these findings it is hoped that by understanding the visual search patterns of the experienced DBT radiologists, it could potentially help DBT trainees to develop more efficient interpretation approaches.},

abstract = {At the present time, the information contained in a roentgenogram can be extracted only by a radiologist observing it. That this link can sometimes fail has recently been emphasized by Tuddenham (1) and Garland (2), who have reported frequent perceptual errors by radiologists viewing roentgenograms demonstrating fairly obvious lesions. Such errors have also been shown by Zeidner and Sadacca (3) and Enoch (4) in their studies of photointerpreters reading aerial photographs. There are two stages in the visual perception of detail. First, the object must be focused upon the fovea; second, this focused image must be translated into meaning by the observer's brain. The fovea subtends an angle of only 2°, so that at 30 inches the area of distinct vision is a circle about 1 inch in diameter. Thus, some 300 separate eye fixations are necessary to cover the area presented by a 14 ? 17-inch roentgenogram at this distance. The eye searches the film by moving in small rapid jumps of high velocity (saccadic movements), stopping at intervals and remaining steady before making another jump. It is only during these steady intervals or fixations that we are able to see clearly, for while the eye is moving there is no perception of detail. During any visual task an observer makes many unconscious eye movements and fixations. The eyes receive and transmit to the brain a vast amount of information, several million ?bits? a second, to use the language of communication theory, but the brain can make decisions at a rate equivalent to only about 25 bits a second. Therefore, some selective mechanism must exist controlling the information which rises to conscious levels. Experience and training must be among the factors affecting this selective mechanism, and knowledge of the methods of visual search adopted by the radiologist is necessary if the causes of his perceptual errors are to be discerned. Method The present study is based upon the initial visual search of five radiologists entering training, who viewed six roentgenograms and three projected Rorschach ink blots for thirty seconds each, while their eye movements were recorded by an optical eye-marker camera. The film records were then analyzed for search patterns, fixation times, and distribution of fixations. Rorschach slides were introduced both as a ?control? presentation and as part of a larger study. Viewing was done at a distance of 42 inches because of equipment limitations, although Tuddenham and Enoch have pointed out that the ideal display for initial search subtends an angle of 9° at the eye, which would then place a conventional chest film 8 ft. from the viewer. ?Normal? chest films were used in this first study because it was desired to examine the initial search patterns, and these would be disturbed if any abnormalities became apparent.},

abstract = {A variety of high throughput genome-wide assays enable the exploration of genetic risk factors underlying complex traits. Although these studies have remarkable impact on identifying susceptible biomarkers, they suffer from issues such as limited sample size and low reproducibility. Combining individual studies of different genetic levels/platforms has the promise to improve the power and consistency of biomarker identification. In this paper, we propose a novel integrative method, namely sparse group multitask regression, for integrating diverse omics datasets, platforms, and populations to identify risk genes/factors of complex diseases. This method combines multitask learning with sparse group regularization, which will: (1) treat the biomarker identification in each single study as a task and then combine them by multitask learning; (2) group variables from all studies for identifying significant genes; (3) enforce sparse constraint on groups of variables to overcome the "small sample, but large variables" problem. We introduce two sparse group penalties: sparse group lasso and sparse group ridge in our multitask model, and provide an effective algorithm for each model. In addition, we propose a significance test for the identification of potential risk genes. Two simulation studies are performed to evaluate the performance of our integrative method by comparing it with conventional meta-analysis method. The results show that our sparse group multitask method outperforms meta-analysis method significantly. In an application to our osteoporosis studies, 7 genes are identified as significant genes by our method and are found to have significant effects in other three independent studies for validation. The most significant gene SOD2 has been identified in our previous osteoporosis study involving the same expression dataset. Several other genes such as TREML2, HTR1E, and GLO1 are shown to be novel susceptible genes for osteoporosis, as confirmed from other studies.},

We designed an exonic-resolution array targeting all known submicroscopic chromosomal intellectual disability syndrome loci, causative genes for intellectual disability, and potential candidate genes, all genes encoding glutamate receptors and epigenetic regulators. Using this platform, we performed chromosomal microarray analysis on 165 intellectual disability trios (affected child and both normal parents). We identified and independently validated 36 de novo copy-number changes in 32 trios. In all, 67{\%} of the validated events were intragenic, involving only exon 1 (which includes the promoter sequence according to our design), exon 1 and adjacent exons, or one or more exons excluding exon 1. Seventeen of the 36 copy-number variants involve genes known to cause intellectual disability. Eleven of these, including seven intragenic variants, are clearly pathogenic (involving STXBP1, SHANK3 (3 patients), IL1RAPL1, UBE2A, NRXN1, MEF2C, CHD7, 15q24 and 9p24 microdeletion), two are likely pathogenic (PI4KA, DCX), two are unlikely to be pathogenic (GRIK2, FREM2), and two are unclear (ARID1B, 15q22 microdeletion). Twelve individuals with genomic imbalances identified by our array were tested with a clinical microarray, and six had a normal result. We identified de novo copy-number variants within genes not previously implicated in intellectual disability and uncovered pathogenic variation of known intellectual disability genes below the detection limit of standard clinical diagnostic chromosomal microarray analysis.},

These molecules are investigated extensively while others are not studied at all. In comparison to our detailed knowledge about the role of inflammation in atherosclerosis, little is known about extracellular matrix remodelling and the retention of individual lipid species rather than lipid classes in early and advanced atherosclerotic lesions. The recent development of mass spectrometry-based methods and advanced analytical tools are transforming our ability to profile extracellular proteins and lipid species in animal models and clinical specimen with the goal of illuminating pathological processes and discovering new biomarkers.},

abstract = {Objective: To identify key features contributing to trainees' development of expertise in microscopic pathology diagnosis, a complex visual task, and to provide new insights to help create computer-based training systems in pathology. Design: Standard methods of information-processing and cognitive science were used to study diagnostic processes (search, perception, reasoning) of 28 novices, intermediates, and experts. Participants examined cases in breast pathology; each case had a previously established gold standard diagnosis. Videotapes correlated the actual visual data examined by participants with their verbal "think-aloud" protocols. Measurements: Investigators measured accuracy, difficulty, certainty, protocol process frequencies, error frequencies, and times to key diagnostic events for each case and subject. Analyses of variance, chi-square tests and post-hoc comparisons were performed with subject as the unit of analysis. Results: Level of expertise corresponded with differences in search, perception, and reasoning components of the tasks. Several discrete steps occur on the path to competence, including development of adequate search strategies, rapid and accurate recognition of anatomic location, acquisition of visual data interpretation skills, and transitory reliance on explicit feature identification. Conclusion: Results provide the basis for an empirical cognitive model of competence for the complex tasks of microscopic pathology diagnosis. Results will inform the development of computer-based pedagogy tools in this domain.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Caspase-8 is a key regulator of apoptosis. Its cancer cell antigen induced cell death activity is strongly impacted by the insertion/deletion promoter polymorphism CASP8 -652 6N ins/del (rs3834129). We studied the association of this polymorphism with renal cell carcinoma risk and pathology.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this hospital based case-control study 500 Austrian patients were genotyped, including 250 with renal cell carcinoma, and 250 age and gender matched healthy controls. Polymerase chain reaction amplified genomic DNA was evaluated by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and automatic sequencing. We assessed associations with renal cell carcinoma risk and pathological factors, and performed a meta-analysis of the literature.

RESULTS: The CASP8 -652 6N ins/del polymorphism was significantly linked to renal cell carcinoma (chi-square for trend = 9.50, p = 0.002). Compared with ins/ins, del/del was associated with a 57{\%} decreased risk of the disease (OR 0.43, 95{\%} CI 0.26-0.73, p = 0.002). Furthermore, del/del was associated with a lower risk of distant metastases (p {\textless}0.05) but not with T stage, N stage or grade. On meta-analysis the CASP8 -652 6N ins/del polymorphism was associated with renal cell carcinoma risk (p {\textless}0.001).

CONCLUSIONS: The del/del genotype of the CASP8 -652 6N ins/del promoter polymorphism decreases the overall risk of renal cell carcinoma. It may be associated with a decreased risk of metastasis. Larger studies are warranted to validate our findings.},

abstract = {Abstract: Recent developments in medical informatics research have afforded possibilities for great advances in health care delivery. These exciting opportunities also present formidable challenges to the implementation and integration of technologies in the workplace. As in most domains, there is a gulf between technologic artifacts and end users. Since medical practice is a human endeavor, there is a need for bridging disciplines to enable clinicians to benefit from rapid technologic advances. This in turn necessitates a broadening of disciplinary boundaries to consider cognitive and social factors pertaining to the design and use of technology. The authors argue for a place of prominence for cognitive science. Cognitive science provides a framework for the analysis and modeling of complex human performance and has considerable applicability to a range of issues in informatics. Its methods have been employed to illuminate different facets of design and implementation. This approach has also yielded insights into the mechanisms and processes involved in collaborative design. Cognitive scientific methods and theories are illustrated in the context of two examples that examine human-computer interaction in medical contexts and computer-mediated collaborative processes. The framework outlined in this paper can be used to refine the process of iterative design, end-user training, and productive practice.},

abstract = {The relationship between saccadic eye movements and covert orienting or visual spatial attention was investigated in two experiments. In the first experiment, subjects were required to make a saccade to a specified location while also detecting a visual target presented just prior to the eye movement. Detection accuracy was highest when the location of the target coincided with the location of the saccade, suggesting that subjects use spatial attention in the programming and/or execution of saccadic eye movements. In the second experiment, subjects were explicitly directed to attend to a particular location and to make a saccade to the same location or to a different one. Superior target detection occurred at the saccade location regardless of attention instructions. This finding shows that subjects cannot move their eyes to one location and attend to a different one. The result of these experiments suggest that visuospatial attention is an important mechanism in generating voluntary saccadic eye movements.},

abstract = {Most models of visual search, whether involving overt eye movements or covert shifts of attention, are based on the concept of a saliency map, that is, an explicit two-dimensional map that encodes the saliency or conspicuity of objects in the visual environment. Competition among neurons in this map gives rise to a single winning location that corresponds to the next attended target. Inhibiting this location automatically allows the system to attend to the next most salient location. We describe a detailed computer implementation of such a scheme, focusing on the problem of combining information across modalities, here orientation, intensity and color information, in a purely stimulus-driven manner. The model is applied to common psychophysical stimuli as well as to a very demanding visual search task. Its successful performance is used to address the extent to which the primate visual system carries out visual search via one or more such saliency maps and how this can be tested.

@article{Roux2013,
abstract = {INTRODUCTION: In the framework of the Cognitive Microscope (MICO) project, we have set up a contest about mitosis detection in images of H and E stained slides of breast cancer for the conference ICPR 2012. Mitotic count is an important parameter for the prognosis of breast cancer. However, mitosis detection in digital histopathology is a challenging problem that needs a deeper study. Indeed, mitosis detection is difficult because mitosis are small objects with a large variety of shapes, and they can thus be easily confused with some other objects or artefacts present in the image. We added a further dimension to the contest by using two different slide scanners having different resolutions and producing red-green-blue (RGB) images, and a multi-spectral microscope producing images in 10 different spectral bands and 17 layers Z-stack. 17 teams participated in the study and the best team achieved a recall rate of 0.7 and precision of 0.89. CONTEXT: Several studies on automatic tools to process digitized slides have been reported focusing mainly on nuclei or tubule detection. Mitosis detection is a challenging problem that has not yet been addressed well in the literature. AIMS: Mitotic count is an important parameter in breast cancer grading as it gives an evaluation of the aggressiveness of the tumor. However, consistency, reproducibility and agreement on mitotic count for the same slide can vary largely among pathologists. An automatic tool for this task may help for reaching a better consistency, and at the same time reducing the burden of this demanding task for the pathologists. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Professor Fr$\iota$d$\iota$rique Capron team of the pathology department at Piti$\iota$-Salp$\kappa$tri$\theta$re Hospital in Paris, France, has selected a set of five slides of breast cancer. The slides are stained with H and E. They have been scanned by three different equipments: Aperio ScanScope XT slide scanner, Hamamatsu NanoZoomer 2.0-HT slide scanner and 10 bands multispectral microscope. The data set is made up of 50 high power fields (HPF) coming from 5 different slides scanned at ×40 magnification. There are 10 HPFs/slide. The pathologist has annotated all the mitotic cells manually. A HPF has a size of 512 $\mu$m × 512 $\mu$m (that is an area of 0.262 mm (2) , which is a surface equivalent to that of a microscope field diameter of 0.58 mm. These 50 HPFs contain a total of 326 mitotic cells on images of both scanners, and 322 mitotic cells on the multispectral microscope. RESULTS: Up to 129 teams have registered to the contest. However, only 17 teams submitted their detection of mitotic cells. The performance of the best team is very promising, with F-measure as high as 0.78. However, the database we provided is by far too small for a good assessment of reliability and robustness of the proposed algorithms. CONCLUSIONS: Mitotic count is an important criterion in the grading of many types of cancers, however, very little research has been made on automatic mitotic cell detection, mainly because of a lack of available data. A main objective of this contest was to propose a database of mitotic cells on digitized breast cancer histopathology slides to initiate works on automated mitotic cell detection. In the future, we would like to extend this database to have much more images from different patients and also for different types of cancers. In addition, mitotic cells should be annotated by several pathologists to reflect the partial agreement among them.},

Methods and results:  A VR microscope was designed and implemented by combining ultra-high-resolution displays with VR technology, techniques for fast interaction, and high usability. It was evaluated using a mixed factorial experimental design with technology and task as within-participant variables and grade of histopathologist as a between-participant variable. Time to diagnosis was similar for the conventional and VR microscopes. However, there was a significant difference in the mean magnification used between the two technologies, with participants working at a higher level of magnification on the VR microscope. Conclusions:  The results suggest that, with the right technology, efficient use of digital pathology for routine practice is a realistic possibility. Further work is required to explore what magnification is required on the VR microscope for histopathologists to identify diagnostic features, and the effect on this of the digital slide production process.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVES: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important pathogen. Its resistance to multiple antibiotics and its prevalence in healthcare establishments make it a serious threat to human health that requires novel interventions. Manuka honey is a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent that is gaining acceptance in the topical treatment of wounds. Because its mode of action is only partially understood, proteomic and genomic analysis was used to investigate the effects of manuka honey on MRSA at a molecular level.

METHODS: Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis with dual-channel imaging was combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry to determine the identities of differentially expressed proteins. The expression of the corresponding genes was investigated by quantitative PCR. Microarray analysis provided an overview of alterations in gene expression across the MRSA genome.

RESULTS: Genes with increased expression following exposure to manuka honey were associated with glycolysis, transport and biosynthesis of amino acids, proteins and purines. Those with decreased expression were involved in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, cell division, quorum sensing and virulence. The greatest reductions were seen in genes conferring virulence (sec3, fnb, hlgA, lip and hla) and coincided with a down-regulation of global regulators, such as agr, sae and sarV. A model to illustrate these multiple effects was constructed and implicated glucose, which is one of the major sugars contained in honey.

CONCLUSIONS: A decreased expression of virulence genes in MRSA will impact on its pathogenicity and needs to be investigated in vivo.},

abstract = {The goal of this study was to examine and characterize changes in the ways that pathology residents examine digital whole slide images as they progress through the residency training. A series of 20 digitized breast biopsy whole slide images (half benign and half malignant biopsies) were individually shown to 4 pathology residents at four points in time - at the beginning of their first, second, third, and fourth years of residency. Their task was to examine each image and select three areas that they would most want to zoom in on in order to view the diagnostic detail at higher resolution. Eye position was recorded as they scanned each whole slide image at low magnification. The data indicate that with each successive year of experience, the residents' search patterns do change. Overall, with time, it takes significantly less time to view an individual slide and decide where to zoom, significantly fewer fixations are generated overall, and there is less examination of nondiagnostic areas. Essentially, the residents' search becomes much more efficient. These findings are similar to those in radiology, and support the theory that an important aspect of the development of expertise is improved pattern recognition (taking in more information during the initial Gestalt or gist view) as well as improved allocation of attention and visual processing resources. Progression in improvements in visual search strategies was similar, but not identical, for the 4 residents. ?? 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The explosion of the data both in the biomedical research and in the healthcare systems demands urgent solutions. In particular, the research in omics sciences is moving from a hypothesis-driven to a data-driven approach. Healthcare is additionally always asking for a tighter integration with biomedical data in order to promote personalized medicine and to provide better treatments. Efficient analysis and interpretation of Big Data opens new avenues to explore molecular biology, new questions to ask about physiological and pathological states, and new ways to answer these open issues. Such analyses lead to better understanding of diseases and development of better and personalized diagnostics and therapeutics. However, such progresses are directly related to the availability of new solutions to deal with this huge amount of information. New paradigms are needed to store and access data, for its annotation and integration and finally for inferring knowledge and making it available to researchers. Bioinformatics can be viewed as the "glue" for all these processes. A clear awareness of present high performance computing (HPC) solutions in bioinformatics, Big Data analysis paradigms for computational biology, and the issues that are still open in the biomedical and healthcare fields represent the starting point to win this challenge.},

It is also being used in resident education, in-training examinations (dermatology), and certification examinations (pathology). There are, however, few studies comparing its diagnostic accuracy and acceptability compared with traditional glass slides. This study sought to compare residents' abilities in diagnosing dermatopathology disorders in 2 image formats (traditional microscopic slides and whole mount digitized images) and to assess their perceptions of virtual microscopy in dermatopathology. Residents in dermatology and pathology training programs at 14 institutions were given a randomized combination of 20 virtual and glass slides and were asked to identify the diagnoses from multiple foils. They were then asked to give their impressions about the virtual images. Descriptive data analysis and comparison of groups using Pearson $\chi$2 and Fisher exact tests for categorical variables and Student t test for continuous variables were performed. Residents in dermatology and pathology performed similarly in diagnosing dermatopathology disorders using virtual slides or glass slides (mean [SD] correct for virtual versus glass, 5.48 (1.72) versus 5.57 (2.06); P = .70). The order of administration of virtual versus glass slides did not affect the percentage of questions answered correctly. Most residents supported the use of virtual microscopy as a learning aid, whereas fewer favored its use in testing (79{\%} versus 44{\%}, respectively). Residents performed similarly in making dermatologic diagnoses using virtual slides compared with glass slides despite the residents' preference for the latter. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Our goal was to develop an efficient and reliable performance-based virtual slide competency examination in general surgical pathology that objectively measures pathology resident's morphologic diagnostic skill. A Perl scripted MySQL database was used to develop the test editor and test interface. Virtual slides were created with the Aperio ScanScope. The examination consisted of 20 questions using 20 virtual slides. Slides were chosen to represent general surgical pathology specimens from a variety of organ systems. The examination was administered in a secure environment and was completed in 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Examination reliability, as an indicator of the test's ability to discriminate between trainee ability levels, was excellent (r = 0.84). The linear correlation coefficient of virtual slide competency examination score versus months of surgical pathology training was 0.83 (P = .0001). The learning curve was much steeper early in training. Correlation of virtual slide competency examination performance with resident's performance on the 64 item Resident In-Service Examination surgical pathology subsection was 0.70. Correlation of virtual slide competency examination performance with global end of rotation ratings was 0.28. This pilot implementation demonstrates that it is possible to create a short, reliable performance-based assessment tool for measuring morphologic diagnostic skill using a virtual slide competency examination. Furthermore, the examination as implemented in our program will be a valid measure of an individual resident's progress in morphologic competency. Virtual slide technology and computer accessibility have advanced to the point that the virtual slide competency examination model implemented in our program could have applicability across multiple residency programs. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Software was developed to produce visualizations of the diagnostic track followed by pathologists as they viewed virtual slides. These showed the diagnostic path in four dimensions (x, y, time and zoom), areas studied for {\textgreater}1000 ms, and included pathologists' comments about the areas viewed. The system was used to study two trainee and two expert pathologists diagnosing 60 Barrett's oesophageal biopsy specimens. Comparisons of the diagnostic tracks showed the reason for errors. Forty-six cases had an expert consensus diagnosis. The trainees made errors in 21 and 15 cases, respectively, of which 11 and nine were clinically significant. Errors were made across the whole spectrum of diagnoses from negative to intramucosal carcinoma. Detailed examination of the tracks showed that in all errors there was incorrect interpretation of information; in three errors there was an additional failure to identify diagnostic features. CONCLUSIONS: Tracking with virtual slides is a useful tool in studying diagnosis and error, which has the potential for use in training and assessment.},

Simulation studies demonstrate excellent small-sample properties relative to competing methods.

abstract = {Both clinical and analytical metrics produced by microarray-based assay technology have recognized problems in reproducibility, reliability and analytical sensitivity. These issues are often attributed to poor understanding and control of nucleic acid behaviors and properties at solid-liquid interfaces. Nucleic acid hybridization, central to DNA and RNA microarray formats, depends on the properties and behaviors of single strand (ss) nucleic acids (e.g., probe oligomeric DNA) bound to surfaces. ssDNA's persistence length, radius of gyration, electrostatics, conformations on different surfaces and under various assay conditions, its chain flexibility and curvature, charging effects in ionic solutions, and fluorescent labeling all influence its physical chemistry and hybridization under assay conditions. Nucleic acid (e.g., both RNA and DNA) target interactions with immobilized ssDNA strands are highly impacted by these biophysical states. Furthermore, the kinetics, thermodynamics, and enthalpic and entropic contributions to DNA hybridization reflect global probe/target structures and interaction dynamics. Here we review several biophysical issues relevant to oligomeric nucleic acid molecular behaviors at surfaces and their influences on duplex formation that influence microarray assay performance. Correlation of biophysical aspects of single and double-stranded nucleic acids with their complexes in bulk solution is common. Such analysis at surfaces is not commonly reported, despite its importance to microarray assays. We seek to provide further insight into nucleic acid-surface challenges facing microarray diagnostic formats that have hindered their clinical adoption and compromise their research quality and value as genomics tools.},

abstract = {The morphological interpretation of histologic sections forms the basis of diagnosis and prognostication for cancer. In the diagnosis of carcinomas, pathologists perform a semiquantitative analysis of a small set of morphological features to determine the cancer's histologic grade. Physicians use histologic grade to inform their assessment of a carcinoma's aggressiveness and a patient's prognosis. Nevertheless, the determination of grade in breast cancer examines only a small set of morphological features of breast cancer epithelial cells, which has been largely unchanged since the 1920s. A comprehensive analysis of automatically quantitated morphological features could identify characteristics of prognostic relevance and provide an accurate and reproducible means for assessing prognosis from microscopic image data. We developed the C-Path (Computational Pathologist) system to measure a rich quantitative feature set from the breast cancer epithelium and stroma (6642 features), including both standard morphometric descriptors of image objects and higher-level contextual, relational, and global image features. These measurements were used to construct a prognostic model. We applied the C-Path system to microscopic images from two independent cohorts of breast cancer patients from the Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI) cohort, n = 248, and the Vancouver General Hospital (VGH) cohort, n = 328. The prognostic model score generated by our system was strongly associated with overall survival in both the NKI and the VGH cohorts (both log-rank P 0.001). This association was independent of clinical, pathological, and molecular factors. Three stromal features were significantly associated with survival, and this association was stronger than the association of survival with epithelial characteristics in the model. These findings implicate stromal morphologic structure as a previously unrecognized prognostic determinant for breast cancer.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: While the majority of the health messages on cigarette packages contain threatening health information, previous studies indicate that risk information can trigger defensive reactions, especially when the information is self-relevant (i.e., smokers). Providing coping information, information that provides help for quitting smoking, might increase attention to health messages instead of triggering defensive reactions. METHODS: Eye-movement registration can detect attention preferences for different health education messages over a longer period of time during message exposure. In a randomized, experimental study with 23 smoking and 41 non-smoking student volunteers, eye-movements were recorded for sixteen self-created cigarette packages containing health texts that presented either high risk or coping information combined with a high threat or a low threat smoking-related photo. RESULTS: Results of the eye movement data showed that smokers tend to spend more time looking (i.e., more unique fixations and longer dwell time) at the coping information than at the high risk information irrespective of the content of the smoking-related photo. Non-smokers tend to spend more time looking at the high risk information than at the coping information when the information was presented in combination with a high threat smoking photo. When a low threat photo was presented, non-smokers paid more attention to the coping information than to the high risk information. Results for the smoking photos showed more attention allocation for low threat photos that were presented in combination with high risk information than for low threat photos in combination with coping information . No attention differences were found for the high threat photos. CONCLUSIONS: Non-smokers demonstrated an attention preference for high risk information as opposed to coping information, but only when text information was presented in combination with a high threat photo. For smokers, however, our findings suggest more attention allocation for coping information than for health risk information. This preference for coping information is not reflected in current health messages to motivate smokers to quit smoking. Coping information should be more frequently implemented in health message design to increase attention for these messages and thus contribute to effective persuasion.},

abstract = {Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has enabled researchers to study gene expression at a cellular resolution. However, noise due to amplification and dropout may obstruct analyses, so scalable denoising methods for increasingly large but sparse scRNAseq data are needed. We propose a deep count autoencoder network (DCA) to denoise scRNA-seq datasets. DCA takes the count distribution, overdispersion and sparsity of the data into account using a zero-inflated negative binomial noise model, and nonlinear gene-gene or gene-dispersion interactions are captured. Our method scales linearly with the number of cells and can therefore be applied to datasets of millions of cells. We demonstrate that DCA denoising improves a diverse set of typical scRNA-seq data analyses using simulated and real datasets. DCA outperforms existing methods for data imputation in quality and speed, enhancing biological discovery.},

abstract = {Recent insights into the role of the von-Hippel Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene in hereditary and sporadic clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) have led to new treatments for patients with metastatic ccRCC, although virtually all patients eventually succumb to the disease. We performed an integrated, genome-wide analysis of copy-number changes and gene expression profiles in 90 tumors, including both sporadic and VHL disease-associated tumors, in hopes of identifying new therapeutic targets in ccRCC. We identified 14 regions of nonrandom copy-number change, including 7 regions of amplification (1q, 2q, 5q, 7q, 8q, 12p, and 20q) and 7 regions of deletion (1p, 3p, 4q, 6q, 8p, 9p, and 14q). An analysis aimed at identifying the relevant genes revealed VHL as one of three genes in the 3p deletion peak, CDKN2A and CDKN2B as the only genes in the 9p deletion peak, and MYC as the only gene in the 8q amplification peak. An integrated analysis to identify genes in amplification peaks that are consistently overexpressed among amplified samples confirmed MYC as a potential target of 8q amplification and identified candidate oncogenes in the other regions. A comparison of genomic profiles revealed that VHL disease-associated tumors are similar to a subgroup of sporadic tumors and thus more homogeneous overall. Sporadic tumors without evidence of biallelic VHL inactivation fell into two groups: one group with genomic profiles highly dissimilar to the majority of ccRCC and a second group with genomic profiles that are much more similar to tumors with biallelic inactivation of VHL.},

@article{Spencer2009,
abstract = {Genome-wide association studies are revolutionizing the search for the genes underlying human complex diseases. The main decisions to be made at the design stage of these studies are the choice of the commercial genotyping chip to be used and the numbers of case and control samples to be genotyped. The most common method of comparing different chips is using a measure of coverage, but this fails to properly account for the effects of sample size, the genetic model of the disease, and linkage disequilibrium between SNPs. In this paper, we argue that the statistical power to detect a causative variant should be the major criterion in study design. Because of the complicated pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the human genome, power cannot be calculated analytically and must instead be assessed by simulation. We describe in detail a method of simulating case-control samples at a set of linked SNPs that replicates the patterns of LD in human populations, and we used it to assess power for a comprehensive set of available genotyping chips. Our results allow us to compare the performance of the chips to detect variants with different effect sizes and allele frequencies, look at how power changes with sample size in different populations or when using multi-marker tags and genotype imputation approaches, and how performance compares to a hypothetical chip that contains every SNP in HapMap. A main conclusion of this study is that marked differences in genome coverage may not translate into appreciable differences in power and that, when taking budgetary considerations into account, the most powerful design may not always correspond to the chip with the highest coverage. We also show that genotype imputation can be used to boost the power of many chips up to the level obtained from a hypothetical "complete" chip containing all the SNPs in HapMap. Our results have been encapsulated into an R software package that allows users to design future association studies and our methods provide a framework with which new chip sets can be evaluated.},

@article{Shalek2013,
abstract = {Recent molecular studies have shown that, even when derived from a seemingly homogenous population, individual cells can exhibit substantial differences in gene expression, protein levels and phenotypic output, with important functional consequences. Existing studies of cellular heterogeneity, however, have typically measured only a few pre-selected RNAs or proteins simultaneously, because genomic profiling methods could not be applied to single cells until very recently. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing to investigate heterogeneity in the response of mouse bone-marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) to lipopolysaccharide. We find extensive, and previously unobserved, bimodal variation in messenger RNA abundance and splicing patterns, which we validate by RNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization for select transcripts. In particular, hundreds of key immune genes are bimodally expressed across cells, surprisingly even for genes that are very highly expressed at the population average. Moreover, splicing patterns demonstrate previously unobserved levels of heterogeneity between cells. Some of the observed bimodality can be attributed to closely related, yet distinct, known maturity states of BMDCs; other portions reflect differences in the usage of key regulatory circuits. For example, we identify a module of 137 highly variable, yet co-regulated, antiviral response genes. Using cells from knockout mice, we show that variability in this module may be propagated through an interferon feedback circuit, involving the transcriptional regulators Stat2 and Irf7. Our study demonstrates the power and promise of single-cell genomics in uncovering functional diversity between cells and in deciphering cell states and circuits.},

A "quickscore" has been developed which dispenses with the need to count individual cells. The quantitative biochemical Abbott enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and the Dako immunohistochemical assay (IHA) incorporating a semiquantitative H-score, have been used as standards against which the IHA quickscore for the semiquantitation of oestrogen receptor expression was tested. A good correlation was found between the quickscore and the EIA, which was as good as that between the H-score and EIA. The quickscore is a valid approach and there is no advantage in using the more rigorous H-score. A positive cut off quickscore of {\textgreater} or = 3 has been suggested.},

However, single-cell differences have been largely neglected in the analysis of the functional consequences of genetic variation. Here we measure the expression of 92 genes affected by Wnt signaling in 1,440 single cells from 15 individuals to associate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with gene-expression phenotypes, while accounting for stochastic and cell-cycle differences between cells. We provide evidence that many heritable variations in gene function--such as burst size, burst frequency, cell cycle-specific expression and expression correlation/noise between cells--are masked when expression is averaged over many cells. Our results demonstrate how single-cell analyses provide insights into the mechanistic and network effects of genetic variability, with improved statistical power to model these effects on gene expression.},

Relative species abundance and metabolic characteristics of the intestinal microbiota change substantially in those who are obese or have other metabolic disorders and in response to ingested nutrients or therapeutic agents. The mechanisms through which the intestinal microbiota and its metabolites affect host homeostasis are just beginning to be understood. We review the relationships between the intestinal microbiota and host metabolism, including energy intake, use, and expenditure, in relation to glucose and lipid metabolism. These associations, along with interactions among the intestinal microbiota, mucus layer, bile acids, and mucosal immune responses, reveal potential mechanisms by which the microbiota affect metabolism.

In this review, we discuss these innovative new approaches-including ever finer analyses of transcriptome dynamics, genome structure and genomic variation-and provide an overview of the new insights into complex biological systems catalyzed by these technologies. We also assess the impact of genotyping, genome sequencing and personal omics profiling on medical applications, including diagnosis and disease monitoring.

However, these experiments are prone to high levels of unexplained technical noise, creating new challenges for identifying genes that show genuine heterogeneous expression within the population of cells under study. BASiCS (Bayesian Analysis of Single-Cell Sequencing data) is an integrated Bayesian hierarchical model where: (i) cell-specific normalisation constants are estimated as part of the model parameters, (ii) technical variability is quantified based on spike-in genes that are artificially introduced to each analysed cell's lysate and (iii) the total variability of the expression counts is decomposed into technical and biological components. BASiCS also provides an intuitive detection criterion for highly (or lowly) variable genes within the population of cells under study. This is formalised by means of tail posterior probabilities associated to high (or low) biological cell-to-cell variance contributions, quantities that can be easily interpreted by users. We demonstrate our method using gene expression measurements from mouse Embryonic Stem Cells. Cross-validation and meaningful enrichment of gene ontology categories within genes classified as highly (or lowly) variable supports the efficacy of our approach.},

This theoretical dichotomy, however, fails to explain a growing number of cases in which neither current goals nor physical salience can account for strong selection biases. For example, equally salient stimuli associated with reward can capture attention, even when this contradicts current selection goals. Thus, although 'top-down' sources of bias are sometimes defined as those that are not due to physical salience, this conception conflates distinct - and sometimes contradictory - sources of selection bias. We describe an alternative framework, in which past selection history is integrated with current goals and physical salience to shape an integrated priority map. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Divide-and-conquer based methods for Bayesian inference provide a general approach for tractable posterior inference when the sample size is large. These methods divide the data into smaller subsets, sample from the posterior distribution of parameters in parallel on all the subsets, and combine posterior samples from all the subsets to approximate the full data posterior distribution. The smaller size of any subset compared to the full data implies that posterior sampling on any subset is computationally more efficient than sampling from the true posterior distribution. Since the combination step takes negligible time relative to sampling, posterior computations can be scaled to massive data by dividing the full data into a sufficiently large number of data subsets. One such approach relies on the geometry of posterior distributions estimated across different subsets and combines them through their barycenter in a Wasserstein space of probability measures. We provide theoretical guarantees on the accuracy of approximation that are valid in many applications. We show that the geometric method approximates the full data posterior distribution better than its competitors across diverse simulations and reproduces known results when applied to a movie ratings database.},

@article{Wilkinson,
abstract = {The use of Bayesian inference for the analysis of complex statistical models has increased dramatically in recent years, in part due to the increasing availability of computing power. There are a range of techniques available for carrying out Bayesian inference, but the lack of analytic tractability for the vast majority of models of interest means that most of the tech-niques are numeric, and many are computationally demanding. Indeed, for high-dimensional non-linear models, the only practical methods for analysis are based on Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, and these are notoriously compute intensive, with some analyses requiring weeks of CPU time on powerful computers. It is clear therefore that the use of parallel computing technology in the context of Bayesian computation is of great interest to many who analyse complex models using Bayesian techniques. Section 18.2 considers the key elements of Bayesian inference, and the notion of graphical representation of the conditional independence structure underlying a statistical model. This turns out to be key to exploiting partitioning of computation in a parallel environment. Section 18.3 looks at the issues surrounding Monte Carlo simulation techniques in a parallel environment, laying the foundations for the examination of parallel MCMC in Section 18.4. Standard pseudo-random number generators are not suitable for use in a parallel setting, so this section examines the underlying reasons and the solution to the problem provided by parallel pseudo-random number generators. Parallel MCMC is the topic of Section 18.4. There are two essentially different strategies which can be used for parallelising an MCMC scheme (though these may be combined in a variety of ways). One is based on running multiple MCMC chains in parallel and the other is based on parallelisation of a single MCMC chain. There are different issues related to the different strategies, and each is appropriate in different situations. Indeed, since MCMC in complex models is somewhat of an art-form anyway, with a range of different possible algorithms and trade-offs even in the context of a non-parallel computing environment, the use of a parallel computer adds an additional layer of complexity to the MCMC algorithm design process. That is, the trade-offs one would adopt for the design of an efficient MCMC algorithm for the analysis of a given statistical algorithm in a non-parallel environment may 1 2 CHAPTER 18. PARALLEL BAYESIAN COMPUTATION well be different in a parallel setting, and could depend on the precise nature of the available parallel computing environment. Section 18.4 will attempt to give some background to the kind of trade-offs that are made in the design of an efficient MCMC algorithm, and into the reasons why one might design an algorithm differently depending on the available hardware and software. A wide range of parallel hardware is now available. Dedicated multi-processor parallel computers offer outstanding inter-processor communication speeds, but networked collec-tions of fairly ordinary PCs running a Unix-derived operating system such as Linux offer the opportunity to get super-computer performance for relatively little capital outlay. Linux " Be-owulf " clusters are rapidly becoming the de facto standard for affordable super-computing. The examples given in the later sections use a small 8-CPU Linux cluster. The cluster was formed by four dual CPU PCs together with a cheap file server linked via switched 100 Mbit network (funded by a small grant from the Royal Society). However, the principles apply also to dedicated parallel computers and to much larger Beowulf clusters using faster (Gigabit or ATM) networking infra-structure. As already mentioned, the design of algorithms will often depend to some extent on the parallel architecture. In particular, the number of processors and the speed (and latency) of inter-processor communication are of particular importance. The examples assume a homogeneous cluster (ie. all processors run at the same speed linked by a fairly uniform networking infrastructure), but are easily adapted to non-homogeneous environments. Parallel computing relies on the ability to write programs which exploit multiple proces-sors and processes and transfer information between them. Rather than developing commu-nication protocols from scratch using low level network libraries, it is far more efficient to use specially written message-passing libraries specifically designed for the development of parallel applications. The Parallel Virtual Machines (PVM) library and the Message Passing Interface (MPI) are the most popular choices. MPI is a newer more sophisticated library, and is probably a better choice for people new to parallel computing without an existing PVM code base. The small number of MPI calls necessary for the development of parallel Bayesian inference algorithms will be introduced and illustrated as they are required. Where necessary, ideas are illustrated with the description of algorithms or simple pieces of code written in ANSI 'C'. Experience of programming will be assumed, but no experience of parallel computing is required, nor is extensive knowledge of ANSI 'C'. Note that the examples adapt easily to other languages, and hence are not ANSI 'C' specific. In particular, the key software libraries used (MPI and SPRNG) both have Fortran interfaces, and hence can be used just as easily from Fortran programs. 18.2 Bayesian inference},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to provide the reader with an introduction to the importance of perception research in medical imaging. It is well known that radiologists' performance is not perfect: they make both false positive and false negative decisions, both of which can impact on patient care and treatment. Some of these errors can be attributed to technical difficulties such as underexposing a plain film X-ray image. Such technical explanations cannot, however, account for all the errors that are made; missed lesions are often found in retrospect. These errors can be attributed to perceptual and/or cognitive factors. The study of why these perceptual and cognitive errors occur and what steps can be taken to ameliorate them is a relatively small but growing area in the field of medical imaging. Understanding the capabilities of the human visual system with respect to medical imaging is becoming even more important as we make the transition from the traditional film-based display to soft-copy monitor viewing of medical images. If we understand what the human visual system is capable of, we can tailor the display of medical information to take advantage of these perceptual capacities.},

abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are often deemed too computationally intensive to be of any practical use for big data applications, and in particular for inference on datasets containing a large number {\$}n{\$} of individual data points, also known as tall datasets. In scenarios where data are assumed independent, various approaches to scale up the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in a Bayesian inference context have been recently proposed in machine learning and computational statistics. These approaches can be grouped into two categories: divide-and-conquer approaches and, subsampling-based algorithms. The aims of this article are as follows. First, we present a comprehensive review of the existing literature, commenting on the underlying assumptions and theoretical guarantees of each method. Second, by leveraging our understanding of these limitations, we propose an original subsampling-based approach which samples from a distribution provably close to the posterior distribution of interest, yet can require less than {\$}O(n){\$} data point likelihood evaluations at each iteration for certain statistical models in favourable scenarios. Finally, we have only been able so far to propose subsampling-based methods which display good performance in scenarios where the Bernstein-von Mises approximation of the target posterior distribution is excellent. It remains an open challenge to develop such methods in scenarios where the Bernstein-von Mises approximation is poor.},
annote = {From Duplicate 1 (On Markov chain Monte Carlo methods for tall data - Bardenet, R{\'{e}}mi; Doucet, Arnaud; Holmes, Chris)

This paper describes several methods for improving the performance of MCMC on large (many N) datasets using subsampling and divide and conquer methods. The strengths and limitations of each are appraised, particularly in their ability to target the true posterior distribution, and to reduce the and/or reduce wall clock time.

Divide and conquer methods have the advantage of being independent and thus embarrasingly parallel, however it is noted that there can be severe difficulties in determining the meaning of the combined posteriors resulting from running separate MCMC chains. Thus, these methods cannot be shown to reliably estimate the true posterior. Issues include theoretical advantages relying on batch size approaching infinity, disjoint supports (non-zero regions). 

Scott et al propose using a weighted average for each draw to produce "consensus MCMC" (theoretically supported when Bernstein-von Mises theorem holds). Methods for combining batch posteriors include smoothing with KDEs and then multiplying, smoothing using the Weierstrass transform (combination of batch posterior with sine function), using the Wasserstein barycenter or median of the batch posteriors. Median may cause information loss due to robustness.

The other main category of strategies involve subsampling the data points (eg, samples, cells) used to calculate the likelihood during each iteration of the Markov Chain. This can be done by "naive subsampling" which simply randomly selects (eg) 10{\%} of samples each time, or by more sophisticated methods. For example, Firefly MC establishes b(theta), a lower bound on the likelihood of theta. It then uses Bernoulli variables to select which samples the likelihood should be calculated for, and the lower bound function is substituted for all other samples. Involves some adjustment of the conditionals and an extra step to sample the Bernoulli variables in the MCMC algorithm},

However, algorithms for performing fixation identification are often described informally and rarely compared in a meaningful way. In this paper we propose a taxonomy of fixation identification algorithms that classifies algorithms in terms of how they utilize spatial and temporal information in eye-tracking protocols. Using this taxonomy, we describe five algorithms that are representative of different classes in the taxonomy and $\backslash$nare based on commonly employed techniques. We then evaluate and compare these algorithms with respect to a number of qualitative characteristics. The results of these comparisons offer interesting implications for the use of the various algorithms in future work.},

An organized resource integrating and annotating the ever-increasing genetic data will be imperative to acquire a global view of the cutting-edge in epilepsy research. Herein, we developed EpilepsyGene (http://61.152.91.49/EpilepsyGene). It contains cumulative to date 499 genes and 3931 variants associated with 331 clinical phenotypes collected from 818 publications. Furthermore, in-depth data mining was performed to gain insights into the understanding of the data, including functional annotation, gene prioritization, functional analysis of prioritized genes and overlap analysis focusing on the comorbidity. An intuitive web interface to search and browse the diversified genetic data was also developed to facilitate access to the data of interest. In general, EpilepsyGene is designed to be a central genetic database to provide the research community substantial convenience to uncover the genetic basis of epilepsy.},

abstract = {To clarify genome-wide DNA methylation profiles during multistage renal carcinogenesis, bacterial artificial chromosome array-based methylated CpG island amplification (BAMCA) was performed. Non-cancerous renal cortex tissue obtained from patients with clear cell renal cell carcinomas (RCCs) (N) was at the precancerous stage where DNA hypomethylation and DNA hypermethylation on multiple bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones were observed. By unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis based on BAMCA data for their N, 51 patients with clear cell RCCs were clustered into two subclasses, Clusters A(N) (n = 46) and B(N) (n = 5). Clinicopathologically aggressive clear cell RCCs were accumulated in Cluster B(N), and the overall survival rate of patients in Cluster B(N) was significantly lower than that of patients in Cluster A(N). By unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis based on BAMCA data for their RCCs, 51 patients were clustered into two subclasses, Clusters A(T) (n = 43) and B(T) (n = 8). Clinicopathologically aggressive clear cell RCCs were accumulated in Cluster B(T), and the overall survival rate of patients in Cluster B(T) was significantly lower than that of patients in Cluster A(T). Multivariate analysis revealed that belonging to Cluster B(T) was an independent predictor of recurrence. Cluster B(N) was completely included in Cluster B(T), and the majority of the BAC clones that significantly discriminated Cluster B(N) from Cluster A(N) also discriminated Cluster B(T) from Cluster A(T). In individual patients, DNA methylation status in N was basically inherited by the corresponding clear cell RCC. DNA methylation alterations in the precancerous stage may generate more malignant clear cell RCCs and determine patient outcome.},

However, MCMC cannot be practically applied to large data sets because of the prohibitive cost of evaluating every likelihood term at every iteration. Here we present Firefly Monte Carlo (FlyMC) an auxiliary variable MCMC algorithm that only queries the likelihoods of a potentially small subset of the data at each iteration yet simulates from the exact posterior distribution, in contrast to recent proposals that are approximate even in the asymptotic limit. FlyMC is compatible with a wide variety of modern MCMC algorithms, and only requires a lower bound on the per-datum likelihood factors. In experiments, we find that FlyMC generates samples from the posterior more than an order of magnitude faster than regular MCMC, opening up MCMC methods to larger datasets than were previously considered feasible.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identifying new and more robust assessments of proficiency/expertise  (finding new "biomarkers of expertise") in histopathology is desirable for many reasons. Advances in digital pathology permit new and innovative tests such as flash viewing tests and eye tracking and slide navigation analyses that would not be possible with a traditional microscope. The main purpose of this study was to examine the usefulness of time-restricted testing of expertise in histopathology using digital images. METHODS: 19 novices (undergraduate medical students), 18 intermediates (trainees), and 19 experts (consultants) were invited to give their opinion on 20 general histopathology cases after 1 s and 10 s viewing times. Differences in performance between groups were measured and the internal reliability of the test was calculated. RESULTS: There were highly significant differences in performance between the groups using the Fisher's least significant difference method for multiple comparisons. Differences between groups were consistently greater in the 10-s than the 1-s test. The Kuder-Richardson 20 internal reliability coefficients were very high for both tests: 0.905 for the 1-s test and 0.926 for the 10-s test. Consultants had levels of diagnostic accuracy of 72{\%} at 1 s and 83{\%} at 10 s. CONCLUSIONS: Time-restricted tests using digital images have the potential to be extremely reliable tests of diagnostic proficiency in histopathology. A 10-s viewing test may be more reliable than a 1-s test. Over-reliance on "at a glance" diagnoses in histopathology is a potential source of medical error due to over-confidence bias and premature closure.},

METHODS: EyeCatcher, an eye tracking device, was used to visualise and compare the scanning patterns of five pathologists while they graded two projections of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Density cloud images were created from the scanning patterns. A questionnaire and interview provided information on the following steps in the diagnostic process. RESULTS: EyeCatcher successfully registered the scanning patterns of the pathologists. A "scanning style" and a "selective style" of visual search were distinguished. The scanning patterns, in addition to the interpretation and combination of the information ultimately leading to a diagnosis, varied between the various observers, resulting in a broad range of final diagnoses. CONCLUSIONS: Eye gaze tracking devices provide an excellent basis for further discussion on the interpretation and grading criteria of lesions. As such, they may play an important role in studies on diagnostic decision making in pathology and in the development of training and quality control programmes for pathologists.},

Coupled with concomitant improvements in computer power, this research has resulted in a greater variety of exact procedures becoming feasible for practical use and a considerable increase in the size of data sets to which the procedures can be applied. For some basic analyses of contingency tables, it is unnecessary to use large-sample approximations to sampling distributions when their adequacy is in doubt. This article surveys the current theoretical and computational developments of exact methods for contingency tables. Primary attention is given to the exact conditional approach, which eliminates nuisance parameters by conditioning on their sufficient statistics. The presentation of various exact inferences is unified by expressing them in terms of parameters and their sufficient statistics in loglinear models. Exact approaches for many inferences are not yet addressed in the literature, particularly for multidimensional contingency tables, and this article also suggests additional research for the next decade that would make exact methods yet more widely applicable.},

In our study, we assessed whether these polymorphisms are also associated with RCC risk in a Chinese population. We genotyped these polymorphisms using TaqMan method and assessed their associations with RCC risk in a case-control study of 710 patients with histologically confirmed RCC and 760 cancer-free controls. Normal renal tissues adjacent to tumors were used to evaluate the functional consequences of these polymorphisms. We found that rs7105934 was significantly associated with reduced RCC risk [adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.67, 95{\%} confidence intervals (CIs) = 0.47-0.95, GA+AA versus GG], particularly among subgroups of normal-weight individuals (OR = 0.51, 95{\%}CI = 0.29-0.88), never-smokers (OR = 0.53, 95{\%}CI = 0.33-0.85) and non-drinkers (OR = 0.57, 95{\%}CI = 0.370.87). Furthermore, the rs7105934 GA genotype was associated with lower levels of CCND1 mRNA compared with GG genotype, although this association was only marginally significant (P = 0.055). No significant association between rs7579899 or rs7105934 and RCC risk was observed. Our results suggest that rs7105934 on 11q13.3 may confer susceptibility to RCC in our population. Large population-based prospective and functional studies are required to validate the associations between these loci and RCC risk.},

abstract = {The introduction of in vitro nucleic acid amplification techniques, led by real-time PCR, into the clinical microbiology laboratory has transformed the laboratory detection of viruses and select bacterial pathogens. However, the progression of the molecular diagnostic revolution currently relies on the ability to efficiently and accurately offer multiplex detection and characterization for a variety of infectious disease pathogens. Microarray analysis has the capability to offer robust multiplex detection but has just started to enter the diagnostic microbiology laboratory. Multiple microarray platforms exist, including printed double-stranded DNA and oligonucleotide arrays, in situ-synthesized arrays, high-density bead arrays, electronic microarrays, and suspension bead arrays. One aim of this paper is to review microarray technology, highlighting technical differences between them and each platform's advantages and disadvantages. Although the use of microarrays to generate gene expression data has become routine, applications pertinent to clinical microbiology continue to rapidly expand. This review highlights uses of microarray technology that impact diagnostic microbiology, including the detection and identification of pathogens, determination of antimicrobial resistance, epidemiological strain typing, and analysis of microbial infections using host genomic expression and polymorphism profiles.},

@article{Kemker2017,
abstract = {Deep neural networks are used in many state-of-the-art systems for machine perception. Once a network is trained to do a specific task, e.g., bird classification, it cannot easily be trained to do new tasks, e.g., incrementally learning to recognize additional bird species or learning an entirely different task such as flower recognition. When new tasks are added, typical deep neural networks are prone to catastrophically forgetting previous tasks. Networks that are capable of assimilating new information incrementally, much like how humans form new memories over time, will be more efficient than re-training the model from scratch each time a new task needs to be learned. There have been multiple attempts to develop schemes that mitigate catastrophic forgetting, but these methods have not been directly compared, the tests used to evaluate them vary considerably, and these methods have only been evaluated on small-scale problems (e.g., MNIST). In this paper, we introduce new metrics and benchmarks for directly comparing five different mechanisms designed to mitigate catastrophic forgetting in neural networks: regularization, ensembling, rehearsal, dual-memory, and sparse-coding. Our experiments on real-world images and sounds show that the mechanism(s) that are critical for optimal performance vary based on the incremental training paradigm and type of data being used, but they all demonstrate that the catastrophic forgetting problem has yet to be solved.},

abstract = {Purpose We compared performance and visual search parameters of radiologists detecting masses on mammograms by using both a head-mounted (HDMT) and a remote (REM) eye tracker. Materials and Methods Five experienced radiologists read twice a case set of 20 one-view (medial-lateral oblique) mammograms, of which 12 contained a malignant mass and eight were lesion-free. For each observer, one trial used an HDMT eye-tracking system and the other used an REM system. Trials were separated on average by 2 months. Time to hit the location of the mass, dwell, and number of fixations in the location of the mass were measured. The same parameters were measured on a per-trial basis to determine whether there were memory effects from the previous trial. Results Dwell times in the location of true-positive, false-positive, and false-negative results were significantly shorter (P {\textless} .05) using the HDMT (median, 0.395 seconds) than REM (median, 0.482 seconds) systems, but the number of fixations in the location of the response was smaller using the REM system (median, 4.33 versus 5.0 for the HDMT). The observed differences did not seem to be caused by a memory effect. In addition, the relative lack of head mobility using the REM system caused observers to report neck strain. Conclusion Overall, radiologists' visual search behavior was very similar using both types of eye-tracking device. However, because the REM system did not contain a magnetic head tracker, radiologists were allowed very limited head movements when using it, which made them uncomfortable during the experiment.},

abstract = {To explore the distinct genotypic and phenotypic states of melanoma tumors, we applied single-cell RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to 4645 single cells isolated from 19 patients, profiling malignant, immune, stromal, and endothelial cells. Malignant cells within the same tumor displayed transcriptional heterogeneity associated with the cell cycle, spatial context, and a drug-resistance program. In particular, all tumors harbored malignant cells from two distinct transcriptional cell states, such that tumors characterized by high levels of the MITF transcription factor also contained cells with low MITF and elevated levels of the AXL kinase. Single-cell analyses suggested distinct tumor microenvironmental patterns, including cell-to-cell interactions. Analysis of tumor-infiltrating T cells revealed exhaustion programs, their connection to T cell activation and clonal expansion, and their variability across patients. Overall, we begin to unravel the cellular ecosystem of tumors and how single-cell genomics offers insights with implications for both targeted and immune therapies.},

The purpose of this study was to assess if the introduction of two educational interventions improved the visual diagnostic reasoning skills of novices. These were (1) the active use of key diagnostic features and (2) image repetition. A pre-test and post-test research design was used to compare the two teaching interventions to a traditional teaching group and an expert group using eye tracking as an assessment method. The time to diagnosis and the percentage of time spent viewing an area of diagnostic interest (AOI) were compared using independent t -tests, paired t -tests, and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Diagnostic accuracy as a dichotomous variable was compared using chi-square tables. Students taught in an active-learning manner with image repetition behaved most like experts, with no significant difference from experts for percentage of time spent in the AOIs and a significantly faster time to diagnosis than experts ( p},

abstract = {PURPOSE: PAR-1 mediates angiogenesis and impacts the process of tumor growth and disease progression. We evaluated the associations of the gene variations PAR-1 IVSn -14 A{\textgreater}T (rs168753), -506 Ins/Del (rs11267092) and -1426 C{\textgreater}T (rs32934) with renal cell carcinoma pathology and cancer specific survival.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood leukocytes of 236 consecutive patients with renal cell carcinoma. Genotyping was done using restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis of polymerase chain reaction amplicons and sequencing.

RESULTS: The IVSn -14 AA genotype was associated with a 3.13-fold increased risk of distant metastases (p = 0.015). In addition, cancer specific survival of patients with IVSn -14 AA was significantly worse than in those with AT/TT (HR 2.98, p = 0.019). The 1 and 4-year cancer specific survival rate for AA vs AT/TT was 89{\%} vs 99{\%} and 82{\%} vs 92{\%}, respectively. After adjusting for the stage, size, grade and necrosis (SSIGN) score on multivariable analysis, IVSn -14 AA was identified as an independent adverse prognostic factor (HR 2.72, p = 0.044). The variations -506 Ins/Del and -1426 C{\textgreater}T were not significantly associated with pathological factors or cancer specific survival.

CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that the AA genotype of the PAR-1 variation IVSn -14 A{\textgreater}T is associated with an increased risk of metastasis and poorer prognosis of renal cell carcinoma. Therefore, assessing the individual risk based on genotypes may be a helpful adjunct to identify subgroups at high risk for a poor clinical outcome.},

abstract = {Although genomewide RNA expression analysis has become a routine tool in biomedical research, extracting biological insight from such information remains a major challenge. Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets. },

Image analysis was performed in mammographic regions that attracted radiologists' attention and in all abnormal regions. Machine learning algorithms were investigated to develop predictive models that link: (i) image content with gaze, (ii) image content and gaze with cognition, and (iii) image content, gaze, and cognition with diagnostic error. Both group-based and individualized models were explored.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: By pooling the data from all readers, machine learning produced highly accurate predictive models linking image content, gaze, and cognition. Potential linking of those with diagnostic error was also supported to some extent. Merging readers' gaze metrics and cognitive opinions with computer-extracted image features identified 59{\%} of the readers' diagnostic errors while confirming 97.3{\%} of their correct diagnoses. The readers' individual perceptual and cognitive behaviors could be adequately predicted by modeling the behavior of others. However, personalized tuning was in many cases beneficial for capturing more accurately individual behavior.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: There is clearly an interaction between radiologists' gaze, diagnostic decision, and image content which can be modeled with machine learning algorithms.},

abstract = {A computer adaptable method for finding similarities in the amino acid sequences of two proteins has been developed. From these findings it is possible to determine whether significant homology exists between the proteins. This information is used to trace their possible evolutionary development. The maximum match is a number dependent upon the similarity of the sequences. One of its definitions is the largest number of amino acids of one protein that can be matched with those of a second protein allowing for all possible interruptions in either of the sequences. While the interruptions give rise to a very large number of comparisons, the method efficiently excludes from consideration those comparisons that cannot contribute to the maximum match. Comparisons are made from the smallest unit of significance, a pair of amino acids, one from each protein. All possible pairs are represented by a two-dimensional array, and all possible comparisons are represented by pathways through the array. For this maximum match only certain of the possible pathways must be evaluated. A numerical value, one in this case, is assigned to every cell in the array representing like amino acids. The maximum match is the largest number that would result from summing the cell values of every pathway.},

Materials and Methods: Lung cancer cell lines (A549, NCI-H1650) were irradiated with several fractionation schemes. Clonogenic assays were used to identify radioresistant cell lines. We compared the gene expression profiles on a cDNA microarray. Results: Four established cell (A549-2G, A549-5G, H1650-2G and H1650-5G) were shown to be radioresistant (p≤0.05). Seventy-two genes were commonly altered in A549-G and 655 genes in H1650-G, compared to their parental cells. Genes in the wingless-type MMTV integration site family (WNT) signaling pathway were the ones most frequently altered in both A549-G and H1650-G cells. Those involved in inflammation; integrin, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), interleukin, transforming growth factor-beta (TGFB), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling, were commonly altered in radioresistant H1650 sublines.

abstract = {CONTEXT: There is increasing interest in using whole slide imaging (WSI) for diagnostic purposes (primary and/or consultation). An important consideration is whether WSI can safely replace conventional light microscopy as the method by which pathologists review histologic sections, cytology slides, and/or hematology slides to render diagnoses. Validation of WSI is crucial to ensure that diagnostic performance based on digitized slides is at least equivalent to that of glass slides and light microscopy. Currently, there are no standard guidelines regarding validation of WSI for diagnostic use.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nOBJECTIVE: To recommend validation requirements for WSI systems to be used for diagnostic purposes.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nDESIGN: The College of American Pathologists Pathology and Laboratory Quality Center convened a nonvendor panel from North America with expertise in digital pathology to develop these validation recommendations. A literature review was performed in which 767 international publications that met search term requirements were identified. Studies outside the scope of this effort and those related solely to technical elements, education, and image analysis were excluded. A total of 27 publications were graded and underwent data extraction for evidence evaluation. Recommendations were derived from the strength of evidence determined from 23 of these published studies, open comment feedback, and expert panel consensus.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: Twelve guideline statements were established to help pathology laboratories validate their own WSI systems intended for clinical use. Validation of the entire WSI system, involving pathologists trained to use the system, should be performed in a manner that emulates the laboratory's actual clinical environment. It is recommended that such a validation study include at least 60 routine cases per application, comparing intraobserver diagnostic concordance between digitized and glass slides viewed at least 2 weeks apart. It is important that the validation process confirm that all material present on a glass slide to be scanned is included in the digital image.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSIONS: Validation should demonstrate that the WSI system under review produces acceptable digital slides for diagnostic interpretation. The intention of validating WSI systems is to permit the clinical use of this technology in a manner that does not compromise patient care.},

While these new and enigmatic players in the complex transcriptional milieu are encoded by a significant proportion of the genome, their functions are mostly unknown. Early discoveries support a paradigm in which lncRNAs regulate transcription via chromatin modulation, but new functions are steadily emerging.

abstract = {Spatial gene expression patterns enable the detection of local covariability and are extremely useful for identifying local gene interactions during normal development. The abundance of spatial expression data in recent years has led to the modeling and analysis of regulatory networks. The inherent complexity of such data makes it a challenge to extract biological information. We developed staNMF, a method that combines a scalable implementation of nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) with a new stability-driven model selection criterion. When applied to a set ofDrosophilaearly embryonic spatial gene expression images, one of the largest datasets of its kind, staNMF identified 21 principal patterns (PP). Providing a compact yet biologically interpretable representation ofDrosophilaexpression patterns, PP are comparable to a fate map generated experimentally by laser ablation and show exceptional promise as a data-driven alternative to manual annotations. Our analysis mapped genes to cell-fate programs and assigned putative biological roles to uncharacterized genes. Finally, we used the PP to generate local transcription factor regulatory networks. Spatially local correlation networks were constructed for six PP that span along the embryonic anterior-posterior axis. Using a two-tail 5{\%} cutoff on correlation, we reproduced 10 of the 11 links in the well-studied gap gene network. The performance of PP with theDrosophiladata suggests that staNMF provides informative decompositions and constitutes a useful computational lens through which to extract biological insight from complex and often noisy gene expression data.},

As a consequence, there has been growing interest in developing methods to integrate such data in order to obtain deeper insights regarding the underlying biological system. A key challenge for integrative studies is the heterogeneity present in the different omics data sources, which makes it difficult to discern the coordinated signal of interest from source-specific noise or extraneous effects. RESULTS: We introduce a novel method of multi-modal data analysis that is designed for heterogeneous data based on nonnegative matrix factorization. We provide an algorithm for jointly decomposing the data matrices involved that also includes a sparsity option for high-dimensional settings. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated on synthetic data and on real DNA methylation, gene expression, and miRNA expression data from ovarian cancer samples obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The results show the presence of common modules across patient samples linked to cancer-related pathways, as well as previously established ovarian cancer subtypes.

Despite this clinical urgency, only a small fraction of the regulatory DNA repertoire has been confirmed through reporter gene assays. The overall success rate of functional validation of candidate regulatory elements is low. Moreover, the number and diversity of datasets from which putative regulatory elements can be identified is large and rapidly increasing. We generated a flexible and user-friendly tool to integrate the information from different types of genomic datasets, e.g. ATAC-seq, ChIP-seq, conservation, aiming to increase the ease and success rate of functional prediction. To this end, we developed the EMERGE program that merges all datasets that the user considers informative and uses a logistic regression framework, based on validated functional elements, to set optimal weights to these datasets. ROC curve analysis shows that a combination of datasets leads to improved prediction of tissue-specific enhancers in human, mouse and Drosophila genomes. Functional assays based on this prediction can be expected to have substantially higher success rates. The resulting integrated signal for prediction of functional elements can be plotted in a build-in genome browser or exported for further analysis.},

While heterogeneity of gene expression levels has been extensively studied, less attention has been paid to mRNA polyadenylation isoform choice. 3' untranslated regions regulate mRNA fate, and their choice is tightly controlled during development, but how 3' isoform usage varies within genetically and developmentally homogeneous cell populations has not been explored. Here, we perform genome-wide quantification of polyadenylation site usage in single mouse embryonic and neural stem cells using a novel single-cell transcriptomic method, BATSeq. By applying BATBayes, a statistical framework for analyzing single-cell isoform data, we find that while the developmental state of the cell globally determines isoform usage, single cells from the same state differ in the choice of isoforms. Notably this variation exceeds random selection with equal preference in all cells, a finding that was confirmed by RNA FISH data. Variability in 3' isoform choice has potential implications on functional cell-to-cell heterogeneity as well as utility in resolving cell populations.},

abstract = {Background

DNA methylation plays a key role in developmental processes, which is reflected in changing methylation patterns at specific CpG sites over the lifetime of an individual. The underlying mechanisms are complex and possibly affect multiple genes or entire pathways.
Results

We applied a multivariate approach to identify combinations of CpG sites that undergo modifications when transitioning between developmental stages. Monte Carlo feature selection produced a list of ranked and statistically significant CpG sites, while rule-based models allowed for identifying particular methylation changes in these sites.

Our rule-based classifier reports combinations of CpG sites, together with changes in their methylation status in the form of easy-to-read IF-THEN rules, which allows for identification of the genes associated with the underlying sites.
Conclusion

We utilized machine learning and statistical methods to discretize decision class (age) values to get a general pattern of methylation changes over the lifespan. The CpG sites present in the significant rules were annotated to genes involved in brain formation, general development, as well as genes linked to cancer and Alzheimer's disease.},

abstract = {Systems as diverse as the interacting species in a community, alleles at a genetic locus, and companies in a market are characterized by competition (over resources, space, capital, etc) and adaptation. Neutral theory, built around the hypothesis that individual performance is independent of group membership, has found utility across the disciplines of ecology, population genetics, and economics, both because of the success of the neutral hypothesis in predicting system properties and because deviations from these predictions provide information about the underlying dynamics. However, most tests of neutrality are weak, based on static system properties such as species-abundance distributions or the number of singletons in a sample. Time-series data provide a window onto a system's dynamics, and should furnish tests of the neutral hypothesis that are more powerful to detect deviations from neutrality and more informative about to the type of competitive asymmetry that drives the deviation. Here, we present a neutrality test for time-series data. We apply this test to several microbial time-series and financial time-series and find that most of these systems are not neutral. Our test isolates the covariance structure of neutral competition, thus facilitating further exploration of the nature of asymmetry in the covariance structure of competitive systems. Much like neutrality tests from population genetics that use relative abundance distributions have enabled researchers to scan entire genomes for genes under selection, we anticipate our time-series test will be useful for quick significance tests of neutrality across a range of ecological, economic, and sociological systems for which time-series data are available. Future work can use our test to categorize and compare the dynamic fingerprints of particular competitive asymmetries (frequency dependence, volatility smiles, etc) to improve forecasting and management of complex adaptive systems.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: RNA-RNA interactions via base pairing play a vital role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression. Efficient identification of targets for such regulatory RNAs needs not only discriminative power for positive and negative RNA-RNA interacting sequence data but also accurate prediction of interaction sites from positive data. Recently, a few studies have incorporated interaction site accessibility into their prediction methods, indicating the enhancement of predictive performance on limited positive data.
RESULTS: Here we show the efficacy of our accessibility-based prediction model RactIPAce on newly compiled datasets. The first experiment in interaction site prediction shows that RactIPAce achieves the best predictive performance on the newly compiled dataset of experimentally verified interactions in the literature as compared with the state-of-the-art methods. In addition, the second experiment in discrimination between positive and negative interacting pairs reveals that the combination of accessibility-based methods including our approach can be effective to discern real interacting RNAs. Taking these into account, our prediction model can be effective to predict interaction sites after screening for real interacting RNAs, which will boost the functional analysis of regulatory RNAs.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: RNA binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in post-transcriptional control of gene expression, including splicing, transport, polyadenylation and RNA stability. To model protein-RNA interactions by considering all available sources of information, it is necessary to integrate the rapidly growing RBP experimental data with the latest genome annotation, gene function, RNA sequence and structure. Such integration is possible by matrix factorization, where current approaches have an undesired tendency to identify only a small number of the strongest patterns with overlapping features. Because protein-RNA interactions are orchestrated by multiple factors, methods that identify discriminative patterns of varying strengths are needed. RESULTS: We have developed an integrative orthogonality-regularized nonnegative matrix factorization (iONMF) to integrate multiple data sources and discover non-overlapping, class-specific RNA binding patterns of varying strengths. The orthogonality constraint halves the effective size of the factor model and outperforms other NMF models in predicting RBP interaction sites on RNA. We have integrated the largest data compendium to date, which includes 31 CLIP experiments on 19 RBPs involved in splicing (such as hnRNPs, U2AF2, ELAVL1, TDP-43, and FUS) and processing of 3'UTR (Ago, IGF2BP). We show that the integration of multiple data sources improves the predictive accuracy of retrieval of RNA binding sites. In our study the key predictive factors of protein-RNA interactions were the position of RNA structure and sequence motifs, RBP co-binding and gene region type. We report on a number of protein-specific patterns, many of which are consistent with experimentally determined properties of RBPs.

Most global analyses of the innate immune response have focused on transcription induced by defined immunostimulatory ligands, such as lipopolysaccharide. However, the response to pathogens involves additional complexity, as pathogens interfere with virtually every step of gene expression. How cells respond to pathogen-mediated disruption of gene expression to nevertheless initiate protective responses remains unclear. We previously discovered that a pathogen-mediated blockade of host protein synthesis provokes the production of specific pro-inflammatory cytokines. It remains unclear how these cytokines are produced despite the global pathogen-induced block of translation. We addressed this question by using parallel RNAseq and ribosome profiling to characterize the response of macrophages to infection with the intracellular bacterial pathogen Legionella pneumophila.

Analogous processes take place in diverse situations (such as cardiac tissue, where spiral waves occur in potentially fatal ventricular fibrillation) so a deeper understanding of this additional layer of self-organized pattern formation would be beneficial to a wide range of applications. One of the most striking differences between pattern-forming systems in physics or chemistry and those in biology is the potential importance of variability. In the former, system components are essentially identical with random fluctuations determining the details of the self-organization process and the resulting patterns. In biology, due to variability, the properties of potentially very few cells can have a driving influence on the resulting asymptotic collective state of the colony. Variability is one means of implementing a few-element control on the collective mode. Regulatory architectures, parameters of signaling cascades, and properties of structure formation processes can be "reverse-engineered" from observed spatiotemporal patterns, as different types of regulation and forms of interactions between the constituents can lead to markedly different correlations. The power of this biology-inspired view of pattern formation lies in building a bridge between two scales: the patterns as a collective state of a very large number of cells on the one hand, and the internal parameters of the single cells on the other.},

abstract = {Most cancers in humans are large, measuring centimetres in diameter, and composed of many billions of cells. An equivalent mass of normal cells would be highly heterogeneous as a result of the mutations that occur during each cell division. What is remarkable about cancers is that virtually every neoplastic cell within a large tumour often contains the same core set of genetic alterations, with heterogeneity confined to mutations that emerge late during tumour growth. How such alterations expand within the spatially constrained three-dimensional architecture of a tumour, and come to dominate a large, pre-existing lesion, has been unclear. Here we describe a model for tumour evolution that shows how short-range dispersal and cell turnover can account for rapid cell mixing inside the tumour. We show that even a small selective advantage of a single cell within a large tumour allows the descendants of that cell to replace the precursor mass in a clinically relevant time frame. We also demonstrate that the same mechanisms can be responsible for the rapid onset of resistance to chemotherapy. Our model not only provides insights into spatial and temporal aspects of tumour growth, but also suggests that targeting short-range cellular migratory activity could have marked effects on tumour growth rates.},

Several alternative mechanisms have been proposed suggesting that 5hmC influences either replication dependent maintenance of DNA methylation or replication independent processes of active demethylation. Using high resolution hairpin oxidative bisulfite sequencing data, we precisely determine the amount of 5mC and 5hmC and model the contribution of 5hmC to processes of demethylation in mouse ESCs.

abstract = {RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) play important roles in the post-transcriptional control of RNAs. Identifying RBP binding sites and characterizing RBP binding preferences are key steps toward understanding the basic mechanisms of the post-transcriptional gene regulation. Though numerous computational methods have been developed for modeling RBP binding preferences, discovering a complete structural representation of the RBP targets by integrating their available structural features in all three dimensions is still a challenging task. In this paper, we develop a general and flexible deep learning framework for modeling structural binding preferences and predicting binding sites of RBPs, which takes (predicted) RNA tertiary structural information into account for the first time. Our framework constructs a unified representation that characterizes the structural specificities of RBP targets in all three dimensions, which can be further used to predict novel candidate binding sites and discover potential binding motifs. Through testing on the real CLIP-seq datasets, we have demonstrated that our deep learning framework can automatically extract effective hidden structural features from the encoded raw sequence and structural profiles, and predict accurate RBP binding sites. In addition, we have conducted the first study to show that integrating the additional RNA tertiary structural features can improve the model performance in predicting RBP binding sites, especially for the polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTB), which also provides a new evidence to support the view that RBPs may own specific tertiary structural binding preferences. In particular, the tests on the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) segments yield satisfiable results with experimental support from the literature and further demonstrate the necessity of incorporating RNA tertiary structural information into the prediction model.

abstract = {Although human tumours are shaped by the genetic evolution of cancer cells, evidence also suggests that they display hierarchies related to developmental pathways and epigenetic programs in which cancer stem cells (CSCs) can drive tumour growth and give rise to differentiated progeny. Yet, unbiased evidence for CSCs in solid human malignancies remains elusive. Here we profile 4,347 single cells from six IDH1 or IDH2 mutant human oligodendrogliomas by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) and reconstruct their developmental programs from genome-wide expression signatures. We infer that most cancer cells are differentiated along two specialized glial programs, whereas a rare subpopulation of cells is undifferentiated and associated with a neural stem cell expression program. Cells with expression signatures for proliferation are highly enriched in this rare subpopulation, consistent with a model in which CSCs are primarily responsible for fuelling the growth of oligodendroglioma in humans. Analysis of copy number variation (CNV) shows that distinct CNV sub-clones within tumours display similar cellular hierarchies, suggesting that the architecture of oligodendroglioma is primarily dictated by developmental programs. Subclonal point mutation analysis supports a similar model, although a full phylogenetic tree would be required to definitively determine the effect of genetic evolution on the inferred hierarchies. Our single-cell analyses provide insight into the cellular architecture of oligodendrogliomas at single-cell resolution and support the cancer stem cell model, with substantial implications for disease management.},

Such stationary activity of neurons may be expected for recordings from in vitro slices or anesthetized animals. However, modeling activity of cortical circuitries of awake animals has been more challenging because both spike-rates and interactions can change according to sensory stimulation, behavior, or an internal state of the brain. Previous approaches modeling the dynamics of neural interactions suffer from computational cost; therefore, its application was limited to only a dozen neurons. Here by introducing multiple analytic approximation methods to a state-space model of neural population activity, we make it possible to estimate dynamic pairwise interactions of up to 60 neurons. More specifically, we applied the pseudolikelihood approximation to the state-space model, and combined it with the Bethe or TAP mean-field approximation to make the sequential Bayesian estimation of the model parameters possible. The large-scale analysis allows us to investigate dynamics of macroscopic properties of neural circuitries underlying stimulus processing and behavior. We show that the model accurately estimates dynamics of network properties such as sparseness, entropy, and heat capacity by simulated data, and demonstrate utilities of these measures by analyzing activity of monkey V4 neurons as well as a simulated balanced network of spiking neurons.},

Classifying tumors into different subtypes greatly benefits therapeutic development and facilitates application of precision medicine on patients.

We combine high quality single-cell measurements of the response of yeast cells to repeated hyperosmotic shocks and state-of-the-art statistical inference approaches for mixed-effects models to infer multidimensional parameter distributions describing the population, and then derive specific parameters for individual cells. The analysis of single-cell parameters shows that single-cell identity (e.g. gene expression dynamics, cell size, growth rate, mother-daughter relationships) is, at least partially, captured by the parameter values of gene expression models (e.g. rates of transcription, translation and degradation).

It is an ongoing search in the field to understand the ways in which a logarithmic sensor can be implemented at the molecular level. In this work, we present evidence that logarithmic sensing can be implemented with a single protein, by means of allosteric regulation. Specifically, we find that mathematical models show that allosteric proteins can respond to stimuli on a logarithmic scale. Next, we present evidence from measurements in the literature that some allosteric proteins do operate in a parameter regime that permits logarithmic sensing. Finally, we present examples suggesting that allosteric proteins are indeed used in this capacity: allosteric proteins play a prominent role in systems where fold-change detection has been proposed.

Background

There are increasing efforts to bring high-throughput systems biology techniques to bear on complex animal model systems, often with a goal of learning about underlying regulatory network structures (e.g., gene regulatory networks). However, complex animal model systems typically have significant limitations on cohort sizes, number of samples, and the ability to perform follow-up and validation experiments. These constraints are particularly problematic for many current network learning approaches, which require large numbers of samples and may predict many more regulatory relationships than actually exist.
Results

Here, we test the idea that by leveraging the accuracy and efficiency of classifiers, we can construct high-quality networks that capture important interactions between variables in datasets with few samples. We start from a previously-developed tree-like Bayesian classifier and generalize its network learning approach to allow for arbitrary depth and complexity of tree-like networks. Using four diverse sample networks, we demonstrate that this approach performs consistently better at low sample sizes than the Sparse Candidate Algorithm, a representative approach for comparison because it is known to generate Bayesian networks with high positive predictive value. We develop and demonstrate a resampling-based approach to enable the identification of a viable root for the learned tree-like network, important for cases where the root of a network is not known a priori. We also develop and demonstrate an integrated resampling-based approach to the reduction of variable space for the learning of the network. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of this approach via the analysis of a transcriptional dataset of a malaria challenge in a non-human primate model system, Macaca mulatta, suggesting the potential to capture indicators of the earliest stages of cellular differentiation during leukopoiesis.
Conclusions

We demonstrate that by starting from effective and efficient approaches for creating classifiers, we can identify interesting tree-like network structures with significant ability to capture the relationships in the training data. This approach represents a promising strategy for inferring networks with high positive predictive value under the constraint of small numbers of samples, meeting a need that will only continue to grow as more high-throughput studies are applied to complex model systems.},

In particular, we adopted several synthetic gene circuits to program collective survival in Escherichia coli: the engineered bacteria could only survive when present at sufficiently high population densities. When encapsulated by permeable membranes, these bacteria can sense the local environment and respond accordingly. The cells inside the microbial swarmbot capsules will survive due to their high densities. Those escaping from a capsule, however, will be killed due to a decrease in their densities.

abstract = {Motivation: Understanding the interactions of different DNA binding proteins is a crucial first step toward deciphering gene regulatory mechanism. With advances of high-throughput sequencing technology such as ChIP-seq, the genome-wide binding sites of many proteins have been profiled under different biological contexts. It is of great interest to quantify the spatial correlations of the binding sites, such as their overlaps, to provide information for the interactions of proteins. Analyses of the overlapping patterns of binding sites have been widely performed, mostly based on ad hoc methods. Due to the heterogeneity and the tremendous size of the genome, such methods often lead to biased even erroneous results.

Results: In this work, we discover a Simpson's paradox phenomenon in assessing the genome-wide spatial correlation of protein binding sites. Leveraging information from publicly available data, we propose a testing procedure for evaluating the significance of overlapping from a pair of proteins, which accounts for background artifacts and genome heterogeneity. Real data analyses demonstrate that the proposed method provide more biologically meaningful results.

Although the exact function of many circRNAs is largely unknown, the cell type-- and tissue-specific circRNA expression has implicated their crucial functions in many biological processes. Hence, the quantification of circRNA expression from high-throughput RNA-seq data is becoming important to ascertain. Although many model-based methods have been developed to quantify linear RNA expression from RNA-seq data, these methods are not applicable to circRNA quantification.
Results: Here we proposed a novel strategy that transforms circular transcripts to pseudo-linear transcripts and estimates the expression values of both circular and linear transcripts using an existing model-based algorithm, Sailfish. The new strategy can accurately estimate transcript expression of both linear and circular transcripts from RNA-seq data. Several factors, such as gene length, amount of expression, and the ratio of circular to linear transcripts, had impacts on quantification performance of circular transcripts. In comparison to count-based tools, the new computational framework had superior performance in estimating the amount of circRNA expression from both simulated and real ribosomal RNA-depleted (rRNA-depleted) RNA-seq datasets. On the other hand, the consideration of circular transcripts in expression quantification from rRNA-depleted RNA-seq data showed substantial increased accuracy of linear transcript expression. Our proposed strategy was implemented in a program named Sailfish-cir.

abstract = {Gene expression is intrinsically a stochastic (noisy) process with important implications for cellular functions. Deciphering the underlying mechanisms of gene expression noise remains one of the key challenges of regulatory biology. Theoretical models of transcription often incorporate the kinetics of how transcription factors (TFs) interact with a single promoter to impact gene expression noise. However, inside single cells multiple identical gene copies as well as additional binding sites can compete for a limiting pool of TFs. Here we develop a simple kinetic model of transcription, which explicitly incorporates this interplay between TF copy number and its binding sites. We show that TF sharing enhances noise in mRNA distribution across an isogenic population of cells. Moreover, when a single gene copy shares it's TFs with multiple competitor sites, the mRNA variance as a function of the mean remains unaltered by their presence. Hence, all the data for variance as a function of mean expression collapse onto a single master curve independent of the strength and number of competitor sites. However, this result does not hold true when the competition stems from multiple copies of the same gene. Therefore, although previous studies showed that the mean expression follows a universal master curve, our findings suggest that different scenarios of competition bear distinct signatures at the level of variance. Intriguingly, the introduction of competitor sites can transform a unimodal mRNA distribution into a multimodal distribution. These results demonstrate the impact of limited availability of TF resource on the regulation of noise in gene expression.},

Results

Here, we perform formaldehyde RNA immunoprecipitation (fRIP-Seq) to survey the RNA associated with a panel of 24 chromatin regulators and traditional RNA binding proteins. For each protein that reproducibly bound measurable quantities of bulk RNA (90 {\%} of the panel), we detect enrichment for hundreds to thousands of both noncoding and mRNA transcripts.
Conclusion

For each protein, we find that the enriched sets of RNAs share distinct biochemical, functional, and chromatin properties. Thus, these data provide evidence for widespread specific and relevant RNA association across diverse classes of chromatin-modifying complexes.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: DNA methylation is a key epigenetic modification that can modulate gene expression. Over the past decade, a lot of studies have focused on profiling DNA methylation and investigating its alterations in complex diseases such as cancer. While early studies were mostly restricted to CpG islands or promoter regions, recent findings indicate that many of important DNA methylation changes can occur in other regions and DNA methylation needs to be examined on a genome-wide scale. In this article, we apply the wavelet-based functional mixed model methodology to analyze the high-throughput methylation data for identifying differentially methylated loci across the genome. Contrary to many commonly-used methods that model probes independently, this framework accommodates spatial correlations across the genome through basis function modeling as well as correlations between samples through functional random effects, which allows it to be applied to many different settings and potentially leads to more power in detection of differential methylation. RESULTS: We applied this framework to three different high-dimensional methylation data sets (CpG Shore data, THREE data, and NIH Roadmap Epigenomics data), studied previously in other works. A simulation study based on CpG Shore data suggested that in terms of detection of differentially methylated loci, this modeling approach using wavelets outperforms analogous approaches modeling the loci as independent. For the THREE data, the method suggests newly detected regions of differential methylation, which were not reported in the original study.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The chemical master equation is the fundamental equation of stochastic chemical kinetics. This differential-difference equation describes temporal evolution of the probability density function for states of a chemical system. A state of the system, usually encoded as a vector, represents the number of entities or copy numbers of interacting species, which are changing according to a list of possible reactions. It is often the case, especially when the state vector is high-dimensional, that the number of possible states the system may occupy is too large to be handled computationally. One way to get around this problem is to consider only those states that are associated with probabilities that are greater than a certain threshold level.RESULTS:We introduce an algorithm that significantly reduces computational resources and is especially powerful when dealing with multi-modal distributions. The algorithm is built according to two key principles. Firstly, when performing time integration, the algorithm keeps track of the subset of states with significant probabilities (essential support). Secondly, the probability distribution that solves the equation is parametrised with a small number of coefficients using collocation on Gaussian radial basis functions. The system of basis functions is chosen in such a way that the solution is approximated only on the essential support instead of the whole state space.DISCUSSION:In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the method, we consider four application examples: a) the self-regulating gene model, b) the 2-dimensional bistable toggle switch, c) a generalisation of the bistable switch to a 3-dimensional tristable problem, and d) a 3-dimensional cell differentiation model that, depending on parameter values, may operate in bistable or tristable modes. In all multidimensional examples the manifold containing the system states with significant probabilities undergoes drastic transformations over time. This fact makes the examples especially challenging for numerical methods.CONCLUSIONS:The proposed method is a new numerical approach permitting to approximately solve a wide range of problems that have been hard to tackle until now. A full representation of multi-dimensional distributions is recovered. The method is especially attractive when dealing with models that yield solutions of a complex structure, for instance, featuring multi-stability.},

abstract = {Summary: Chromatin Immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) generates local accumulations of sequencing reads on the genome ("peaks"), which correspond to specific protein-DNA interactions or chromatin modifications. Peaks are detected by considering their total area above a background signal, usually neglecting their shapes, which instead may convey additional biological information. We present FunChIP, an R/Bioconductor package for clustering peaks according to a functional representation of their shapes: after approximating their profiles with cubic B-splines, FunChIP minimises their functional distance and classifies the peaks applying a k-mean alignment and clustering algorithm. The whole pipeline is user-friendly and provides visualisation functions for a quick inspection of the results. An application to the transcription factor Myc in 3T9 murine fibroblasts shows that clusters of peaks with different shapes are associated with different genomic locations and different transcriptional regulatory activity.

abstract = {Pre-mRNA splicing is a central step in the shaping of the eukaryotic transcriptome and in the regulation of gene expression. Yet, due to a focus on fully processed mRNA, common approaches for defining pre-mRNA splicing genome-wide are suboptimal—especially with respect to defining the branch point sequence, a key cis-element that initiates the chemistry of splicing. Here, we report a complementary intron-centered approach designed to more efficiently, simply, and directly define splicing events genome-wide. Specifically, we developed a method distinguished by deep sequencing of lariat intron termini (LIT-seq). In a test of LIT-seq using the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we not only successfully captured the majority of annotated, expressed splicing events but also uncovered 45 novel splicing events, establishing the sensitivity of LIT-seq. Moreover, our libraries were highly enriched with reads that reported on splice sites; by a simple and direct inspection of sequencing reads, we empirically defined both 5′ splice sites and branch sites, as well as their consensus sequences, with nucleotide resolution. Additionally, our study revealed that the 3′ termini of lariat introns are subject to nontemplated addition of adenosines, characteristic of signals sensed by 3′ to 5′ RNA turnover machinery. Collectively, this work defines a novel, genome-wide approach for analyzing splicing with unprecedented depth, specificity, and resolution.},

Background

The spatial distribution of many genes has been visualized during the embryonic development in the starlet sea anemone Nematostella vectensis in the last decade. In situ hybridization images are available in the Kahi Kai gene expression database, and a method has been developed to quantify spatial gene expression patterns of N. vectensis. In this paper, gene expression quantification is performed on a wide range of gene expression patterns from this database and descriptions of observed expression domains are stored in a separate database for further analysis.
Methods

Spatial gene expression from suitable in situ hybridization images has been quantified with the GenExp program. A correlation analysis has been performed on the resulting numerical gene expression profiles for each stage. Based on the correlated clusters of spatial gene expression and detailed descriptions of gene expression domains, various mechanisms for developmental gene expression are proposed.
Results

In the blastula and gastrula stages of development in N. vectensis, its continuous sheet of cells is partitioned into correlating gene expression domains. During progressing development, these regions likely correspond to different fates. A statistical analysis shows that genes generally remain expressed during the planula stages in those major regions that they occupy at the end of gastrulation.
Discussion

Observed shifts in gene expression domain boundaries suggest that elongation in the planula stage mainly occurs in the vegetal ring under the influence of the gene Rx. The secondary body axis in N. vectensis is proposed to be determined at the mid blastula transition.
Conclusions

Early gene expression domains in N. vectensis appear to maintain a positional order along the primary body axis. Early determination in N. vectensis occurs in two stages: expression in broad circles and rings in the blastula is consolidated during gastrulation, and more complex expression patterns appear in the planula within these broad regions. Quantification and comparison of gene expression patterns across a database can generate hypotheses about collective cell movements before these movements are measured directly.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP) is an experimental method based on next-generation sequencing for identifying the RNA interaction sites of a given protein. The method deliberately inserts T-to-C substitutions at the RNA-protein interaction sites, which provides a second layer of evidence compared to other CLIP methods. However, the experiment includes several sources of noise which cause both low-frequency errors and spurious high-frequency alterations. Therefore, rigorous statistical analysis is required in order to separate true T-to-C base changes, following cross-linking, from noise. So far, most of the existing PAR-CLIP data analysis methods focus on discarding the low-frequency errors and rely on high-frequency substitutions to report binding sites, not taking into account the possibility of high-frequency false positive substitutions. RESULTS: Here, we introduce BMix, a new probabilistic method which explicitly accounts for the sources of noise in PAR-CLIP data and distinguishes cross-link induced T-to-C substitutions from low and high-frequency erroneous alterations. We demonstrate the superior speed and accuracy of our method compared to existing approaches on both simulated and real, publicly available human datasets.

Our approach introduces local approximations of these models into the Metropolis-Hastings kernel, borrowing ideas from deterministic approximation theory, optimization, and experimental design. Previous efforts at integrating approximate models into inference typically sacrifice either the sampler's exactness or efficiency; our work seeks to address these limitations by exploiting useful convergence characteristics of local approximations. We prove the ergodicity of our approximate Markov chain, showing that it samples asymptotically from the exact posterior distribution of interest. We describe variations of the algorithm that employ either local polynomial approximations or local Gaussian process regressors. Our theoretical results reinforce the key observation underlying this paper: when the likelihood has some local regularity, the number of model evaluations per MCMC step can be greatly reduced without biasing the Monte Carlo average. Numerical experiments demonstrate multiple order-of-magnitude reductions in the number of forward model evaluations used in representative ODE and PDE inference problems, with both synthetic and real data. },

abstract = {Alternative splicing is an important mechanism in eukaryotes that expands the transcriptome and proteome significantly. It plays an important role in a number of biological processes. Understanding its regulation is hence an important challenge. Recently, increasing evidence has been collected that supports an involvement of intragenic DNA methylation in the regulation of alternative splicing. The exact mechanisms of regulation, however, are largely unknown, and speculated to be complex: different methylation profiles might exist, each of which could be associated with a different regulation mechanism. We present a computational technique that is able to determine such stable methylation patterns and allows to correlate these patterns with inclusion propensity of exons. Pattern detection is based on dynamic time warping (DTW) of methylation profiles, a sophisticated similarity measure for signals that can be non-trivially transformed. We design a flexible self-organizing map approach to pattern grouping. Exemplary application on available data sets indicates that stable patterns which correlate non-trivially with exon inclusion do indeed exist. To improve the reliability of these predictions, further studies on larger data sets will be required. We have thus taken great care that our software runs efficiently on modern hardware, so that it can support future studies on large-scale data sets.},

abstract = {Genetically identical cells in microbial populations often exhibit a remarkable degree of phenotypic heterogeneity even in homogenous environments. Such heterogeneity is commonly thought to represent a bet-hedging strategy against environmental uncertainty. However, evolutionary game theory predicts that phenotypic heterogeneity may also be a response to negative frequency-dependent interactions that favor rare phenotypes over common ones. Here we provide experimental evidence for this alternative explanation in the context of the well-studied yeast GAL network. In an environment containing the two sugars glucose and galactose, the yeast GAL network displays stochastic bimodal activation. We show that in this mixed sugar environment, GAL-ON and GAL-OFF phenotypes can each invade the opposite phenotype when rare and that there exists a resulting stable mix of phenotypes. Consistent with theoretical predictions, the resulting stable mix of phenotypes is not necessarily optimal for population growth. We find that the wild-type mixed strategist GAL network can invade populations of both pure strategists while remaining uninvasible by either. Lastly, using laboratory evolution we show that this mixed resource environment can directly drive the de novo evolution of clonal phenotypic heterogeneity from a pure strategist population. Taken together, our results provide experimental evidence that negative frequency-dependent interactions can underlie the phenotypic heterogeneity found in clonal microbial populations.},

In this study, we show that introns determine the ratio of ribosomal protein isoforms through asymmetric paralog-specific regulation of splicing. Exchanging the introns and 3′ untranslated regions of the duplicated RPS9 genes altered the splicing efficiency and changed the ratio of the ribosomal protein isoforms. Mutational analysis of the RPS9 genes indicated that splicing is regulated by variations in the intron structure and the 3′ untranslated region. Together these data suggest that preferential splicing of duplicated RPGs provides a means for adjusting the ratio of different ribosomal protein isoforms, while maintaining the overall expression level of each ribosomal protein.},

abstract = {Chromatin structure at the length scale encompassing local nucleosome-nucleosome interactions is thought to play a crucial role in regulating transcription and access to DNA. However, this secondary structure of chromatin remains poorly understood compared with the primary structure of single nucleosomes or the tertiary structure of long-range looping interactions. Here we report the first genome-wide map of chromatin conformation in human cells at the 1-3 nucleosome (50-500 bp) scale, obtained using ionizing radiation-induced spatially correlated cleavage of DNA with sequencing (RICC-seq) to identify DNA-DNA contacts that are spatially proximal. Unbiased analysis of RICC-seq signal reveals regional enrichment of DNA fragments characteristic of alternating rather than adjacent nucleosome interactions in tri-nucleosome units, particularly in H3K9me3-marked heterochromatin. We infer differences in the likelihood of nucleosome-nucleosome contacts among open chromatin, H3K27me3-marked, and H3K9me3-marked repressed chromatin regions. After calibrating RICC-seq signal to three-dimensional distances, we show that compact two-start helical fibre structures with stacked alternating nucleosomes are consistent with RICC-seq fragmentation patterns from H3K9me3-marked chromatin, while non-compact structures and solenoid structures are consistent with open chromatin. Our data support a model of chromatin architecture in intact interphase nuclei consistent with variable longitudinal compaction of two-start helical fibres.},

abstract = {Motivation: Neural activities of the brain occur through the formation of spatio-temporal patterns. In recent years, macroscopic neural imaging techniques have produced a large body of data on these patterned activities, yet a numerical measure of spatio-temporal coherence has often been reduced to the global order parameter, which does not uncover the degree of spatial correlation. Here, we propose to use the spatial autocorrelation measure Moran's I, which can be applied to capture dynamic signatures of spatial organization. We demonstrate the application of this technique to collective cellular circadian clock activities measured in the small network of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus.

Results: We found that Moran's I is a practical quantitative measure of the degree of spatial coherence in neural imaging data. Initially developed with a geographical context in mind, Moran's I accounts for the spatial organization of any interacting units. Moran's I can be modified in accordance with the characteristic length scale of a neural activity pattern. It allows a quantification of statistical significance levels for the observed patterns. We describe the technique applied to synthetic datasets and various experimental imaging time-series from cultured SCN explants. It is demonstrated that major characteristics of the collective state can be described by Moran's I and the traditional Kuramoto order parameter R in a complementary fashion.},

abstract = {We develop a fast variational approximation scheme for Gaussian process (GP) regression, where the spectrum of the covariance function is subjected to a sparse approximation. Our approach enables uncertainty in covariance function hyperparameters to be treated without using Monte Carlo methods and is robust to overfitting. Our article makes three contributions. First, we present a variational Bayes algorithm for fitting sparse spectrum GP regression models that uses nonconjugate variational message passing to derive fast and efficient updates. Second, we propose a novel adaptive neighbourhood technique for obtaining predictive inference that is effective in dealing with nonstationarity. Regression is performed locally at each point to be predicted and the neighbourhood is determined using a measure defined based on lengthscales estimated from an initial fit. Weighting dimensions according to lengthscales, this downweights variables of little relevance, leading to automatic variable selection and improved prediction. Third, we introduce a technique for accelerating convergence in nonconjugate variational message passing by adapting step sizes in the direction of the natural gradient of the lower bound. Our adaptive strategy can be easily implemented and empirical results indicate significant speedups.},

abstract = {Inorganic-organic hybrid materials such as organically templated metal oxides, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) and organohalide perovskites have been studied for decades, and hydrothermal and (non-aqueous) solvothermal syntheses have produced thousands of new materials that collectively contain nearly all the metals in the periodic table. Nevertheless, the formation of these compounds is not fully understood, and development of new compounds relies primarily on exploratory syntheses. Simulation- and data-driven approaches (promoted by efforts such as the Materials Genome Initiative) provide an alternative to experimental trial-and-error. Three major strategies are: simulation-based predictions of physical properties (for example, charge mobility, photovoltaic properties, gas adsorption capacity or lithium-ion intercalation) to identify promising target candidates for synthetic efforts; determination of the structure-property relationship from large bodies of experimental data, enabled by integration with high-throughput synthesis and measurement tools; and clustering on the basis of similar crystallographic structure (for example, zeolite structure classification or gas adsorption properties). Here we demonstrate an alternative approach that uses machine-learning algorithms trained on reaction data to predict reaction outcomes for the crystallization of templated vanadium selenites. We used information on 'dark' reactions--failed or unsuccessful hydrothermal syntheses--collected from archived laboratory notebooks from our laboratory, and added physicochemical property descriptions to the raw notebook information using cheminformatics techniques. We used the resulting data to train a machine-learning model to predict reaction success. When carrying out hydrothermal synthesis experiments using previously untested, commercially available organic building blocks, our machine-learning model outperformed traditional human strategies, and successfully predicted conditions for new organically templated inorganic product formation with a success rate of 89 per cent. Inverting the machine-learning model reveals new hypotheses regarding the conditions for successful product formation.},

abstract = {Motivation: DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification related to a variety of diseases including cancers. We focus on the methylation data from Illumina's Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip. One of the key issues of methylation analysis is to detect the differential methylation sites between case and control groups. Previous approaches describe data with simple summary statistics or kernel function, and then use statistical tests to determine the difference. However, a summary statistics-based approach cannot capture complicated underlying structure, and a kernel function-based approach lacks interpretability of results.

Results: We propose a novel method D3M, for detection of differential distribution of methylation, based on distribution-valued data. Our method can detect the differences in high-order moments, such as shapes of underlying distributions in methylation profiles, based on the Wasserstein metric. We test the significance of the difference between case and control groups and provide an interpretable summary of the results. The simulation results show that the proposed method achieves promising accuracy and shows favorable results compared with previous methods. Glioblastoma multiforme and lower grade glioma data from The Cancer Genome Atlas show that our method supports recent biological advances and suggests new insights.

Moreover, identifying RBPs by computational prediction is much more efficient than experimental methods and may have guiding significance on the experiment design.
RESULTS: In this study, we present the RBPPred (an RNA-binding protein predictor), a new method based on the support vector machine, to predict whether a protein binds RNAs, based on a comprehensive feature representation. By integrating the physicochemical properties with the evolutionary information of protein sequences, the new approach RBPPred performed much better than state-of-the-art methods. The results show that RBPPred correctly predicted 83{\%} of 2780 RBPs and 96{\%} out of 7093 non-RBPs with MCC of 0.808 using the 10-fold cross validation. Furthermore, we achieved a sensitivity of 84{\%}, specificity of 97{\%} and MCC of 0.788 on the testing set of human proteome. In addition we tested the capability of RBPPred to identify new RBPs, which further confirmed the practicability and predictability of the method.

We developed an algorithm to identify genetic polymorphisms that modulate the regulatory connectivity between specific transcription factors and their target genes in vivo. As a proof of principle, we mapped connectivity quantitative trait loci (cQTLs) using parallel genotype and gene expression data for segregants from a cross between two strains of the yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae We identified a nonsynonymous mutation in theDIG2gene as a cQTL for the transcription factor Ste12p and confirmed this prediction empirically.

Their numerical robustness and matrix-free nature have enabled them to make inroads into a variety of applications.

This is a challenging problem that gives rise to an extremely large matrix due to the curse of dimensionality. Inexact Krylov subspace methods that build on truncation techniques have helped solve some {\{}CME{\}} models that were considered computationally out of reach as recently as a few years ago. However, as models grow, truncating them means using an even smaller fraction of their whole extent, thereby introducing more inexactness. But experimental evidence suggests an apparent success and the aim of this study is to give theoretical insights into the reasons why. Essentially, we show that the truncation can be put in the framework of inexact Krylov methods that relax matrix{\^{a}}€“vector products and compute them expediently by trading accuracy for speed.

The proposed algorithms scale well with the state dimension and the length of the temporal horizon with moderate loss in distributional accuracy. They hence provide a flexible and faster alternative to both non-linear filtering-smoothing type algorithms and to approaches that implement the Laplace method or expectation propagation on (block) sparse latent Gaussian models. We infer the parameters of the latent Gaussian model using a structured variational Bayes approach.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Dynamics of cellular processes are often studied using mechanistic mathematical models. These models possess unknown parameters which are generally estimated from experimental data assuming normally distributed measurement noise. Outlier corruption of datasets often cannot be avoided. These outliers may distort the parameter estimates, resulting in incorrect model predictions. Robust parameter estimation methods are required which provide reliable parameter estimates in the presence of outliers.
RESULTS: In this manuscript, we propose and evaluate methods for estimating the parameters of ordinary differential equation models from outlier-corrupted data. As alternatives to the normal distribution as noise distribution, we consider the Laplace, the Huber, the Cauchy and the Student's t distribution. We assess accuracy, robustness and computational efficiency of estimators using these different distribution assumptions. To this end, we consider artificial data of a conversion process, as well as published experimental data for Epo-induced JAK/STAT signaling. We study how well the methods can compensate and discover artificially introduced outliers. Our evaluation reveals that using alternative distributions improves the robustness of parameter estimates.

abstract = {Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) metagenomics is increasingly used to study the structure and functions of complex microbial ecosystems, both from the taxonomic and functional point of view. Gene inventories of otherwise uncultured microbial communities make the direct functional profiling of microbial communities possible. The concept of community aggregated trait has been adapted from environmental and plant functional ecology to the framework of microbial ecology. Community aggregated traits are quantified from WGS data by computing the abundance of relevant marker genes. They can be used to study key processes at the ecosystem level and correlate environmental factors and ecosystem functions. In this paper we propose a novel model based approach to infer combinations of aggregated traits characterizing specific ecosystemic metabolic processes. We formulate a model of these Combined Aggregated Functional Traits (CAFTs) accounting for a hierarchical structure of genes, which are associated on microbial genomes, further linked at the ecosystem level by complex co-occurrences or interactions. The model is completed with constraints specifically designed to exploit available genomic information, in order to favor biologically relevant CAFTs. The CAFTs structure, as well as their intensity in the ecosystem, is obtained by solving a constrained Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) problem. We developed a multicriteria selection procedure for the number of CAFTs. We illustrated our method on the modelling of ecosystemic functional traits of fiber degradation by the human gut microbiota. We used 1408 samples of gene abundances from several high-throughput sequencing projects and found that four CAFTs only were needed to represent the fiber degradation potential. This data reduction highlighted biologically consistent functional patterns while providing a high quality preservation of the original data. Our method is generic and can be applied to other metabolic processes in the gut or in other ecosystems.},

Here we identify N(6)-methyladenine as another form of DNA modification in mouse embryonic stem cells. Alkbh1 encodes a demethylase for N(6)-methyladenine. An increase of N(6)-methyladenine levels in Alkbh1-deficient cells leads to transcriptional silencing. N(6)-methyladenine deposition is inversely correlated with the evolutionary age of LINE-1 transposons; its deposition is strongly enriched at young ({\textless}1.5 million years old) but not old ({\textgreater}6 million years old) L1 elements. The deposition of N(6)-methyladenine correlates with epigenetic silencing of such LINE-1 transposons, together with their neighbouring enhancers and genes, thereby resisting the gene activation signals during embryonic stem cell differentiation. As young full-length LINE-1 transposons are strongly enriched on the X chromosome, genes located on the X chromosome are also silenced. Thus, N(6)-methyladenine developed a new role in epigenetic silencing in mammalian evolution distinct from its role in gene activation in other organisms. Our results demonstrate that N(6)-methyladenine constitutes a crucial component of the epigenetic regulation repertoire in mammalian genomes.},

abstract = {Author Summary Stochastic simulations (simulations where randomness plays a role) of even simple biological systems are often so computationally intensive that it is impossible, in practice, to simulate them exhaustively and gather good statistics about the likelihood of different outcomes. The difficulty is compounded for the observation of rare events in these simulations; unfortunately, rare events, such as state transitions and barrier crossings, are often those of particular interest. Using the weighted ensemble (WE) method, we are able to enhance the characterization of rare events in cell biology simulations, but in such a way that the statistics for these events remain unbiased. The histogram of outcomes that WE produces has the same shape as a naive one, but the resolution of events in the tails of the histogram is greatly improved. This improved resolution in rare event statistics can be used to infer unbiased estimates of long timescale dynamics from short simulations, and we show that using a weighted ensemble can result in a reduction in total simulation time needed to sample certain events of interest in spatial, stochastic models of biological systems.},

abstract = {Integrator is a multi-subunit complex stably associated with the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD) of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII). Integrator is endowed with a core catalytic RNA endonuclease activity, which is required for the 3'-end processing of non-polyadenylated, RNAPII-dependent, uridylate-rich, small nuclear RNA genes. Here we examine the requirement of Integrator in the biogenesis of transcripts derived from distal regulatory elements (enhancers) involved in tissue- and temporal-specific regulation of gene expression in metazoans. Integrator is recruited to enhancers and super-enhancers in a stimulus-dependent manner. Functional depletion of Integrator subunits diminishes the signal-dependent induction of enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) and abrogates stimulus-induced enhancer-promoter chromatin looping. Global nuclear run-on and RNAPII profiling reveals a role for Integrator in 3'-end cleavage of eRNA primary transcripts leading to transcriptional termination. In the absence of Integrator, eRNAs remain bound to RNAPII and their primary transcripts accumulate. Notably, the induction of eRNAs and gene expression responsiveness requires the catalytic activity of Integrator complex. We propose a role for Integrator in biogenesis of eRNAs and enhancer function in metazoans.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: DNA methylation signatures in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have been identified in fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) with Illumina HumanMethylation450 array. Since less than 2{\%} of CpG sites are covered by the Illumina 450K array and whole genome bisulfite sequencing is still too expensive for many samples, computationally predicting DNA methylation levels based on 450K data would be valuable to discover more RA-related genes. RESULTS: We developed a computational model that is trained on 14 tissues with both whole genome bisulfite sequencing and 450K array data. This model integrates information derived from the similarity of local methylation pattern between tissues, the methylation information of flanking CpG sites and the methylation tendency of flanking DNA sequences. The predicted and measured methylation values were highly correlated with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.9 in leave-one-tissue-out cross-validations. Importantly, the majority (76{\%}) of the top 10{\%} differentially methylated loci among the 14 tissues was correctly detected using the predicted methylation values. Applying this model to 450K data of RA, osteoarthritis (OA) and normal fibroblast-like synoviocytes, we successfully expanded the coverage of CpG sites 18.5 fold and accounts for about 30{\%} of all the CpGs in the human genome. By integrative omics study, we identified genes and pathways tightly related to RA pathogenesis, among which twelve genes were supported by triple evidences, including 6 genes already known to perform specific roles in RA and 6 genes as new potential therapeutic targets.

abstract = {Most eukaryotic genes are subject to alternative splicing (AS), which may contribute to the production of functional protein variants or to the regulation of gene expression, notably via nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD). However, a fraction of splice variants might correspond to spurious transcripts, and the question of the relative proportion of splicing errors vs. functional splice variants remains highly debated. We propose here a test to quantify the fraction of AS events corresponding to errors. This test is based on the fact that the fitness cost of splicing errors increases with the number of introns in a gene and with expression level. We first analyzed the transcriptome of the intron-rich unicellular eukaryote Paramecium tetraurelia. We show that both in normal and in NMD-deficient cells, AS rates (intron retention, alternative splice site usage or cryptic intron splicing) strongly decrease with increasing expression level and with increasing number of introns. This relationship is observed both for AS events that are detectable by NMD or not, which invalidates the hypothesis of a possible link with the regulation of gene expression. Our results indicate that in genes with a median expression level, 92{\%}-98{\%} of observed splice variants correspond to errors. Interestingly, we observed the same patterns in human transcriptomes. These results are consistent with the mutation-selection-drift theory, which predicts that genes under weaker selective pressure should accumulate more maladaptive substitutions, and therefore should be more prone to errors of gene expression.},

abstract = {Metazoan genomes are spatially organized at multiple scales, from packaging of DNA around individual nucleosomes to segregation of whole chromosomes into distinct territories. At the intermediate scale of kilobases to megabases, which encompasses the sizes of genes, gene clusters and regulatory domains, the three-dimensional (3D) organization of DNA is implicated in multiple gene regulatory mechanisms, but understanding this organization remains a challenge. At this scale, the genome is partitioned into domains of different epigenetic states that are essential for regulating gene expression. Here we investigate the 3D organization of chromatin in different epigenetic states using super-resolution imaging. We classified genomic domains in Drosophila cells into transcriptionally active, inactive or Polycomb-repressed states, and observed distinct chromatin organizations for each state. All three types of chromatin domains exhibit power-law scaling between their physical sizes in 3D and their domain lengths, but each type has a distinct scaling exponent. Polycomb-repressed domains show the densest packing and most intriguing chromatin folding behaviour, in which chromatin packing density increases with domain length. Distinct from the self-similar organization displayed by transcriptionally active and inactive chromatin, the Polycomb-repressed domains are characterized by a high degree of chromatin intermixing within the domain. Moreover, compared to inactive domains, Polycomb-repressed domains spatially exclude neighbouring active chromatin to a much stronger degree. Computational modelling and knockdown experiments suggest that reversible chromatin interactions mediated by Polycomb-group proteins play an important role in these unique packaging properties of the repressed chromatin. Taken together, our super-resolution images reveal distinct chromatin packaging for different epigenetic states at the kilobase-to-megabase scale, a length scale that is directly relevant to genome regulation.},

abstract = {The well established phenomenon of ribosome drop-off plays crucial roles in translational accuracy and nutrient starvation responses during protein translation. When cells are under stress conditions, such as amino acid starvation or aminoacyl-tRNA depletion due to a high level of recombinant protein expression, ribosome drop-off can substantially affect the efficiency of protein expression. Here we introduce a mathematical model that describes the effects of ribosome drop-off on the ribosome density along the mRNA and on the concomitant protein synthesis rate. Our results show that ribosome premature termination may lead to non-intuitive ribosome density profiles, such as a ribosome density which increases from the 5' to the 3' end. Importantly, the model predicts that the effects of ribosome drop-off on the translation rate are mRNA-specific, and we quantify their resilience to drop-off, showing that the mRNAs which present ribosome queues are much less affected by ribosome drop-off than those which do not. Moreover, among those mRNAs that do not present ribosome queues, resilience to drop-off correlates positively with the elongation rate, so that sequences using fast codons are expected to be less affected by ribosome drop-off. This result is consistent with a genome-wide analysis of S. cerevisiae, which reveals that under favourable growth conditions mRNAs coding for proteins involved in the translation machinery, known to be highly codon biased and using preferentially fast codons, are highly resilient to ribosome drop-off. Moreover, in physiological conditions, the translation rate of mRNAs coding for regulatory, stress-related proteins, is less resilient to ribosome drop-off. This model therefore allows analysis of variations in the translational efficiency of individual mRNAs by accounting for the full range of known ribosome behaviours, as well as explaining mRNA-specific variations in ribosome density emerging from ribosome profiling studies.},

abstract = {Minimally invasive detection of cell death could prove an invaluable resource in many physiologic and pathologic situations. Cell-free circulating DNA (cfDNA) released from dying cells is emerging as a diagnostic tool for monitoring cancer dynamics and graft failure. However, existing methods rely on differences in DNA sequences in source tissues, so that cell death cannot be identified in tissues with a normal genome. We developed a method of detecting tissue-specific cell death in humans based on tissue-specific methylation patterns in cfDNA. We interrogated tissue-specific methylome databases to identify cell type-specific DNA methylation signatures and developed a method to detect these signatures in mixed DNA samples. We isolated cfDNA from plasma or serum of donors, treated the cfDNA with bisulfite, PCR-amplified the cfDNA, and sequenced it to quantify cfDNA carrying the methylation markers of the cell type of interest. Pancreatic $\beta$-cell DNA was identified in the circulation of patients with recently diagnosed type-1 diabetes and islet-graft recipients; oligodendrocyte DNA was identified in patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis; neuronal/glial DNA was identified in patients after traumatic brain injury or cardiac arrest; and exocrine pancreas DNA was identified in patients with pancreatic cancer or pancreatitis. This proof-of-concept study demonstrates that the tissue origins of cfDNA and thus the rate of death of specific cell types can be determined in humans. The approach can be adapted to identify cfDNA derived from any cell type in the body, offering a minimally invasive window for diagnosing and monitoring a broad spectrum of human pathologies as well as providing a better understanding of normal tissue dynamics.},

Nascent transcription assays are a relatively new set of high throughput techniques that measure the location of actively engaged RNA polymerase genome wide. Hence, nascent transcription is a rich source of information on the regulation of RNA polymerase activity. To fully dissect this data requires the development of stochastic models that can both deconvolve the stages of polymerase activity and identify significant changes in activity between experiments.
RESULTS: We present a generative, probabilistic model of RNA polymerase that fully describes loading, initiation, elongation and termination. We fit this model genome wide and profile the enzymatic activity of RNA polymerase across various loci and following experimental perturbation. We observe striking correlation of predicted loading events and regulatory chromatin marks. We provide principled statistics that compute probabilities reminiscent of traveler's and divergent ratios. We finish with a systematic comparison of RNA Polymerase activity at promoter vs non-promoter associated loci.

abstract = {We develop a quantitative single cell-based mathematical model for multi-cellular tumor spheroids (MCTS) of SK-MES-1 cells, a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line, growing under various nutrient conditions: we confront the simulations performed with this model with data on the growth kinetics and spatial labeling patterns for cell proliferation, extracellular matrix (ECM), cell distribution and cell death. We start with a simple model capturing part of the experimental observations. We then show, by performing a sensitivity analysis at each development stage of the model that its complexity needs to be stepwise increased to account for further experimental growth conditions. We thus ultimately arrive at a model that mimics the MCTS growth under multiple conditions to a great extent. Interestingly, the final model, is a minimal model capable of explaining all data simultaneously in the sense, that the number of mechanisms it contains is sufficient to explain the data and missing out any of its mechanisms did not permit fit between all data and the model within physiological parameter ranges. Nevertheless, compared to earlier models it is quite complex i.e., it includes a wide range of mechanisms discussed in biological literature. In this model, the cells lacking oxygen switch from aerobe to anaerobe glycolysis and produce lactate. Too high concentrations of lactate or too low concentrations of ATP promote cell death. Only if the extracellular matrix density overcomes a certain threshold, cells are able to enter the cell cycle. Dying cells produce a diffusive growth inhibitor. Missing out the spatial information would not permit to infer the mechanisms at work. Our findings suggest that this iterative data integration together with intermediate model sensitivity analysis at each model development stage, provide a promising strategy to infer predictive yet minimal (in the above sense) quantitative models of tumor growth, as prospectively of other tissue organization processes. Importantly, calibrating the model with two nutriment-rich growth conditions, the outcome for two nutriment-poor growth conditions could be predicted. As the final model is however quite complex, incorporating many mechanisms, space, time, and stochastic processes, parameter identification is a challenge. This calls for more efficient strategies of imaging and image analysis, as well as of parameter identification in stochastic agent-based simulations.},

abstract = {Rapid and accurate identification of the sequence type (ST) of bacterial pathogens is critical for epidemiological surveillance and outbreak control. Cheaper and faster next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have taken preference over the traditional method of amplicon sequencing for multi locus sequence typing (MLST). But data generated by NGS platforms necessitate quality control, genome assembly and sequence similarity searching before an isolate's ST can be determined. These are computationally intensive and time consuming steps, which are not ideally suited for real-time molecular epidemiology. Here, we present stringMLST, an assembly- and alignment-free, lightweight, platform-independent program capable of rapidly typing bacterial isolates directly from raw sequence reads. The program implements a simple hash table data structure to find exact matches between short sequence strings (k-mers) and an MLST allele library. We show that stringMLST is more accurate, and order of magnitude faster, than its contemporary genome-based ST detection tools.

abstract = {It has been over a decade since the first observation that small non-coding RNAs can functionally modulate epigenetic states in human cells to achieve functional transcriptional gene silencing (TGS). TGS is mechanistically distinct from the RNA interference (RNAi) gene-silencing pathway. TGS can result in long-term stable epigenetic modifications to gene expression that can be passed on to daughter cells during cell division, whereas RNAi does not. Early studies of TGS have been largely overlooked, overshadowed by subsequent discoveries of small RNA-directed post-TGS and RNAi. A reappraisal of early work has been brought about by recent findings in human cells where endogenous long non-coding RNAs function to regulate the epigenome. There are distinct and common overlaps between the proteins involved in small and long non-coding RNA transcriptional regulatory mechanisms, suggesting that the early studies using small non-coding RNAs to modulate transcription were making use of a previously unrecognized endogenous mechanism of RNA-directed gene regulation. Here we review how non-coding RNA plays a role in regulation of transcription and epigenetic gene silencing in human cells by revisiting these earlier studies and the mechanistic insights gained to date. We also provide a list of mammalian genes that have been shown to be transcriptionally regulated by non-coding RNAs. Lastly, we explore how TGS may serve as the basis for development of future therapeutic agents.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Mutual exclusivity is a widely recognized property of many cancer drivers. Knowledge about these relationships can provide important insights into cancer drivers, cancer-driving pathways, and cancer subtypes. It can also be used to predict new functional interactions between cancer driving genes and uncover novel cancer drivers. Currently, most of mutual exclusivity analyses are pre-formed focusing on a limited set of genes in part due to the computational cost required to rigorously compute p-values.
RESULTS: To reduce the computing cost and perform less restricted mutual exclusivity analysis, we developed an efficient method to estimate p-values while controlling the mutation rates of individual patients and genes similar to the permutation test. A comprehensive mutual exclusivity analysis allowed us to uncover mutually exclusive pairs, some of which may have relatively low mutation rates. These pairs often included likely cancer drivers that have been missed in previous analyses. More importantly, our results demonstrated that mutual exclusivity can also provide information that goes beyond the interactions between cancer drivers and can, for example, elucidate different mutagenic processes in different cancer groups. In particular, including frequently mutated, long genes such as TTN in our analysis allowed us to observe interesting patterns of APOBEC activity in breast cancer and identify a set of related driver genes that are highly predictive of patient survival. In addition, we utilized our mutual exclusivity analysis in support of a previously proposed model where APOBEC activity is the underlying process that causes TP53 mutations in a subset of breast cancer cases.

Where ambiguities in assignments exist due to transcripts sharing sequence, e.g. alternative isoforms or alleles, the problem can be solved through probabilistic inference. Bayesian methods have been shown to provide accurate transcript abundance estimates compared with competing methods. However, exact Bayesian inference is intractable and approximate methods such as Markov chain Monte Carlo and Variational Bayes (VB) are typically used. While providing a high degree of accuracy and modelling flexibility, standard implementations can be prohibitively slow for large datasets and complex transcriptome annotations. RESULTS: We propose a novel approximate inference scheme based on VB and apply it to an existing model of transcript expression inference from RNA-seq data. Recent advances in VB algorithmics are used to improve the convergence of the algorithm beyond the standard Variational Bayes Expectation Maximization algorithm. We apply our algorithm to simulated and biological datasets, demonstrating a significant increase in speed with only very small loss in accuracy of expression level estimation. We carry out a comparative study against seven popular alternative methods and demonstrate that our new algorithm provides excellent accuracy and inter-replicate consistency while remaining competitive in computation time.

abstract = {DNA origami is a robust assembly technique that folds a single-stranded DNA template into a target structure by annealing it with hundreds of short 'staple' strands. Its guiding design principle is that the target structure is the single most stable configuration. The folding transition is cooperative and, as in the case of proteins, is governed by information encoded in the polymer sequence. A typical origami folds primarily into the desired shape, but misfolded structures can kinetically trap the system and reduce the yield. Although adjusting assembly conditions or following empirical design rules can improve yield, well-folded origami often need to be separated from misfolded structures. The problem could in principle be avoided if assembly pathway and kinetics were fully understood and then rationally optimized. To this end, here we present a DNA origami system with the unusual property of being able to form a small set of distinguishable and well-folded shapes that represent discrete and approximately degenerate energy minima in a vast folding landscape, thus allowing us to probe the assembly process. The obtained high yield of well-folded origami structures confirms the existence of efficient folding pathways, while the shape distribution provides information about individual trajectories through the folding landscape. We find that, similarly to protein folding, the assembly of DNA origami is highly cooperative; that reversible bond formation is important in recovering from transient misfoldings; and that the early formation of long-range connections can very effectively enforce particular folds. We use these insights to inform the design of the system so as to steer assembly towards desired structures. Expanding the rational design process to include the assembly pathway should thus enable more reproducible synthesis, particularly when targeting more complex structures. We anticipate that this expansion will be essential if DNA origami is to continue its rapid development and become a reliable manufacturing technology.},

abstract = {Transcriptional regulation requires the binding of transcription factors (TFs) to short sequence-specific DNA motifs, usually located at the gene regulatory regions. Interestingly, based on a vast amount of data accumulated from genomic assays, it has been shown that only a small fraction of all potential binding sites containing the consensus motif of a given TF actually bind the protein. Recent in vitro binding assays, which exclude the effects of the cellular environment, also demonstrate selective TF binding. An intriguing conjecture is that the surroundings of cognate binding sites have unique characteristics that distinguish them from other sequences containing a similar motif that are not bound by the TF. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of the sequence and DNA shape features surrounding the core-binding sites of 239 and 56 TFs extracted from in vitro HT-SELEX binding assays and in vivo ChIP-seq data, respectively. Comparing the nucleotide content of the regions around the TF-bound sites to the counterpart unbound regions containing the same consensus motifs revealed significant differences that extend far beyond the core-binding site. Specifically, the environment of the bound motifs demonstrated unique sequence compositions, DNA shape features, and overall high similarity to the core-binding motif. Notably, the regions around the binding sites of TFs that belong to the same TF families exhibited similar features, with high agreement between the in vitro and in vivo data sets. We propose that these unique features assist in guiding TFs to their cognate binding sites.},

@article{mcdonald2016sex,
abstract = {Sex and recombination are pervasive throughout nature despite their substantial costs. Understanding the evolutionary forces that maintain these phenomena is a central challenge in biology. One longstanding hypothesis argues that sex is beneficial because recombination speeds adaptation4. Theory has proposed several distinct population genetic mechanisms that could underlie this advantage. For example, sex can promote the fixation of beneficial mutations either by alleviating interference competition (the Fisher–Muller effect) or by separating them from deleterious load (the ruby in the rubbish effect). Previous experiments confirm that sex can increase the rate of adaptation, but these studies did not observe the evolutionary dynamics that drive this effect at the genomic level. Here we present the first, to our knowledge, comparison between the sequence-level dynamics of adaptation in experimental sexual and asexual Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations, which allows us to identify the specific mechanisms by which sex speeds adaptation. We find that sex alters the molecular signatures of evolution by changing the spectrum of mutations that fix, and confirm theoretical predictions that it does so by alleviating clonal interference. We also show that substantially deleterious mutations hitchhike to fixation in adapting asexual populations. In contrast, recombination prevents such mutations from fixing. Our results demonstrate that sex both speeds adaptation and alters its molecular signature by allowing natural selection to more efficiently sort beneficial from deleterious mutations.},

abstract = {Gene expression is regulated by transcription factors (TFs), proteins that recognize short DNA sequence motifs. Such sequences are very common in the human genome, and an important determinant of the specificity of gene expression is the cooperative binding of multiple TFs to closely located motifs. However, interactions between DNA-bound TFs have not been systematically characterized. To identify TF pairs that bind cooperatively to DNA, and to characterize their spacing and orientation preferences, we have performed consecutive affinity-purification systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (CAP-SELEX) analysis of 9,400 TF-TF-DNA interactions. This analysis revealed 315 TF-TF interactions recognizing 618 heterodimeric motifs, most of which have not been previously described. The observed cooperativity occurred promiscuously between TFs from diverse structural families. Structural analysis of the TF pairs, including a novel crystal structure of MEIS1 and DLX3 bound to their identified recognition site, revealed that the interactions between the TFs were predominantly mediated by DNA. Most TF pair sites identified involved a large overlap between individual TF recognition motifs, and resulted in recognition of composite sites that were markedly different from the individual TF's motifs. Together, our results indicate that the DNA molecule commonly plays an active role in cooperative interactions that define the gene regulatory lexicon.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Accurate detection of differentially expressed genes between tumor and normal samples is a primary approach of cancer-related biomarker identification. Due to the infiltration of tumor surrounding normal cells, the expression data derived from tumor samples would always be contaminated with normal cells. Ignoring such cellular contamination would deflate the power of detecting DE genes and further confound the biological interpretation of the analysis results. For the time being, there does not exist any differential expression analysis approach for RNA-seq data in literature that can properly account for the contamination of tumor samples. RESULTS: Without appealing to any extra information, we develop a new method 'contamDE' based on a novel statistical model that associates RNA-seq expression levels with cell types. It is demonstrated through simulation studies that contamDE could be much more powerful than the existing methods that ignore the contamination. In the application to two cancer studies, contamDE uniquely found several potential therapy and prognostic biomarkers of prostate cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.

However, accurate determination of the underlying diffusive properties, beyond normal diffusion, has remained challenging when analyzing particle trajectories on an individual basis. Here, we introduce the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for confined diffusion and fractional Brownian motion. We demonstrate that this MLE yields improved estimation over traditional mean square displacement analyses. We also introduce a model selection scheme (that we call mleBIC) that classifies individual trajectories to a given diffusion mode. We demonstrate the statistical limitations of classification via mleBIC using simulated data. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a new version of perturbation expectation-maximization (pEMv2), which simultaneously analyzes a collection of particle trajectories to uncover the system of interactions which give rise to unique normal and/or non-normal diffusive states within the population. We test and evaluate the performance of pEMv2 on various sets of simulated particle trajectories, which transition among several modes of normal and non-normal diffusion, highlighting the key considerations for employing this analysis methodology.},

@article{Takemata03032016,
abstract = {It has been postulated that a myriad of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) contribute to gene regulation. In fission yeast, glucose starvation triggers lncRNA transcription across promoter regions of stress-responsive genes including fbp1 (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase1). At the fbp1 promoter, this transcription promotes chromatin remodeling and fbp1 mRNA expression. Here, we demonstrate that such upstream noncoding transcription facilitates promoter association of the stress-responsive transcriptional activator Atf1 at the sites of transcription, leading to activation of the downstream stress genes. Genome-wide analyses revealed that ∼50 Atf1-binding sites show marked decrease in Atf1 occupancy when cells are treated with a transcription inhibitor. Most of these transcription-enhanced Atf1-binding sites are associated with stress-dependent induction of the adjacent mRNAs or lncRNAs, as observed in fbp1. These Atf1-binding sites exhibit low Atf1 occupancy and high histone density in glucose-rich conditions, and undergo dramatic changes in chromatin status after glucose depletion: enhanced Atf1 binding, histone eviction, and histone H3 acetylation. We also found that upstream transcripts bind to the Groucho-Tup1 type transcriptional corepressors Tup11 and Tup12, and locally antagonize their repressive functions on Atf1 binding. These results reveal a new mechanism in which upstream noncoding transcription locally magnifies the specific activation of stress-inducible genes via counteraction of corepressors.},

abstract = {Thus far, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have been disappointing in the inability of investigators to use the results of identified, statistically significant variants in complex diseases to make predictions useful for personalized medicine. Why are significant variables not leading to good prediction of outcomes? We point out that this problem is prevalent in simple as well as complex data, in the sciences as well as the social sciences. We offer a brief explanation and some statistical insights on why higher significance cannot automatically imply stronger predictivity and illustrate through simulations and a real breast cancer example. We also demonstrate that highly predictive variables do not necessarily appear as highly significant, thus evading the researcher using significance-based methods. We point out that what makes variables good for prediction versus significance depends on different properties of the underlying distributions. If prediction is the goal, we must lay aside significance as the only selection standard. We suggest that progress in prediction requires efforts toward a new research agenda of searching for a novel criterion to retrieve highly predictive variables rather than highly significant variables. We offer an alternative approach that was not designed for significance, the partition retention method, which was very effective predicting on a long-studied breast cancer data set, by reducing the classification error rate from 30{\%} to 8{\%}.},

Previous studies suggested a link between the lysine methyltransferase EHMT2 (also known as G9A and KMT1C) and DNA methylation in the mouse. Here, we used a model of knockout mice to explore the role of EHMT2 in DNA methylation during mouse embryogenesis. The Ehmt2 gene is expressed in epiblast cells but is dispensable for global DNA methylation in embryogenesis. In contrast, EHMT2 regulates DNA methylation at specific sequences that include CpG-rich promoters of germline-specific genes. These loci are bound by EHMT2 in embryonic cells, are marked by H3K9 dimethylation, and have strongly reduced DNA methylation in Ehmt2−/− embryos. EHMT2 also plays a role in the maintenance of germline-derived DNA methylation at one imprinted locus, the Slc38a4 gene. Finally, we show that DNA methylation is instrumental for EHMT2-mediated gene silencing in embryogenesis. Our findings identify EHMT2 as a critical factor that facilitates repressive DNA methylation at specific genomic loci during mammalian development.},

abstract = {Motivation: The majority of disease-associated variants identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) reside in noncoding regions of the genome with regulatory roles. Thus being able to interpret the functional consequence of a variant is essential for identifying causal variants in the analysis of GWAS studies. Results: We present GERV (Generative Evaluation of Regulatory Variants), a novel computational method for predicting regulatory variants that affect transcription factor binding. GERV learns a k-mer based generative model of transcription factor binding from ChIP-seq and DNase-seq data, and scores variants by computing the change of predicted ChIP-seq reads between the reference and alternate allele. The k-mers learned by GERV capture more sequence determinants of transcription factor binding than a motif-based approach alone, including both a transcription factor{\~{O}}s canonical motif as well as associated co-factor motifs. We show that GERV outperforms existing methods in predicting SNPs associated with allele-specific binding. GERV correctly predicts a validated causal variant among linked SNPs, and prioritizes the variants previously reported to modulate the binding of FOXA1 in breast cancer cell lines. Thus, GERV provides a powerful approach for functionally annotating and prioritizing causal variants for experimental follow-up analysis.

Language shift can be monitored on a large scale through the use of mathematical models by way of differential equations, for example, reaction-diffusion equations. Here, we use a different approach: we propose a model for language dynamics based on the principles of cellular automata/agent-based modeling and combine it with very detailed empirical data. Our model makes it possible to follow language dynamics over space and time, whereas existing models based on differential equations average over space and consequently provide no information on local changes in language use. Additionally, cellular automata models can be used even in cases where models based on differential equations are not applicable, for example, in situations where one language has become dispersed and retreated to language islands. Using data from a bilingual region in Austria, we show that the most important factor in determining the spread and retreat of a language is the interaction with speakers of the same language. External factors like bilingual schools or parish language have only a minor influence.},

Although the catalog of known AS events has grown ever since, novel transcripts are commonly observed when working with less well annotated organisms, in the context of disease, or within large populations. Whereas an identification of complete transcripts is technically challenging and computationally expensive, focusing on single splicing events as a proxy for transcriptome characteristics is fruitful and sufficient for a wide range of analyses.

abstract = {Motivation: Large-scale gene expression profiling has been widely used to characterize cellular states in response to various disease conditions, genetic perturbations, etc. Although the cost of whole-genome expression profiles has been dropping steadily, generating a compendium of expression profiling over thousands of samples is still very expensive. Recognizing that gene expressions are often highly correlated, researchers from the NIH LINCS program have developed a cost-effective strategy of profiling only {\~{}}1,000 carefully selected landmark genes and relying on computational methods to infer the expression of remaining target genes. However, the computational approach adopted by the LINCS program is currently based on linear regression, limiting its accuracy since it does not capture complex nonlinear relationship between expression of genes.Results: We present a deep learning method (abbreviated as D-GEX) to infer the expression of target genes from the expression of landmark genes. We used the microarray-based GEO dataset, consisting of 111K expression profiles, to train our model and compare its performance to those from other methods. In terms of mean absolute error averaged across all genes, deep learning significantly outperforms linear regression with 15.33{\%} relative improvement. A gene-wise comparative analysis shows that deep learning achieves lower error than linear regression in 99.97{\%} of the target genes. We also tested the performance of our learned model on an independent RNA-Seq-based GTEx dataset, which consists of 2,921 expression profiles.

abstract = {Motivation: Feature selection, identifying a subset of variables that are relevant for predicting a re-sponse, is an important and challenging component of many methods in statistics and machine learning. Feature selection is especially difficult and computationally intensive when the number of variables approaches or exceeds the number of samples, as is often the case for many genomic datasets. Results: Here, we introduce a new approach{\^{a}}the Bayesian Ising Approximation (BIA){\^{a}}to rapidly calculate posterior probabilities for feature relevance in L2 penalized linear regression. In the re-gime where the regression problem is strongly regularized by the prior, we show that computing the marginal posterior probabilities for features is equivalent to computing the magnetizations of an Ising model with weak couplings. Using a mean field approximation, we show it is possible to rapidly compute the feature selection path described by the posterior probabilities as a function of the L2 penalty. We present simulations and analytical results illustrating the accuracy of the BIA on some simple regression problems. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of the BIA to high-di-mensional regression by analyzing a gene expression dataset with nearly 30 000 features. These re-sults also highlight the impact of correlations between features on Bayesian feature selection.

abstract = {MicroRNAs play important roles in a large variety of biological systems and processes through their regulation of target mRNA expression, and show promise as clinical biomarkers. However, their small size presents challenges for tagging or direct detection. Innovation in techniques to sense and quantify microRNAs may aid research into novel aspects of microRNA biology and contribute to the development of diagnostics. By introducing an additional stem loop into the fluorescent RNA Spinach and altering its 3′ and 5′ ends, we have generated a new RNA, Pandan, that functions as the basis for a microRNA sensor. Pandan contains two sequence-variable stem loops that encode complementary sequence for a target microRNA of interest. In its sensor form, it requires the binding of a target microRNA in order to reconstitute the RNA scaffold for fluorophore binding and fluorescence. Binding of the target microRNA resulted in large changes in fluorescence intensity. The median fold change in fluorescence observed for the sensors tested was ∼50-fold. Pandan RNA sensors exhibit good signal-to-noise ratios, and can detect their target microRNAs within complex RNA mixtures.},

We show that AC-PCA can adjust for (i) variations across individual donors present in a human brain exon array dataset and (ii) variations of different species in a model organism ENCODE RNA sequencing dataset. Our approach is able to recover the anatomical structure of neocortical regions and to capture the shared variation among species during embryonic development.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Mutations (or Single Nucleotide Variants) in folded RiboNucleic Acid structures that cause local or global conformational change are riboSNitches. Predicting riboSNitches is challenging, as it requires making two, albeit related, structure predictions. The data most often used to experimentally validate riboSNitch predictions is Selective 2' Hydroxyl Acylation by Primer Extension, or SHAPE. Experimentally establishing a riboSNitch requires the quantitative comparison of two SHAPE traces: wild-type (WT) and mutant. Historically, SHAPE data was collected on electropherograms and change in structure was evaluated by "gel gazing." SHAPE data is now routinely collected with next generation sequencing and/or capillary sequencers. We aim to establish a classifier capable of simulating human "gazing" by identifying features of the SHAPE profile that human experts agree "looks" like a riboSNitch.
RESULTS: We find strong quantitative agreement between experts when RNA scientists "gaze" at SHAPE data and identify riboSNitches. We identify dynamic time warping and seven other features predictive of the human consensus. The classSNitch classifier reported here accurately reproduces human consensus for 167 mutant/WT comparisons with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) above 0.8. When we analyze 2019 mutant traces for 17 different RNAs, we find that features of the WT SHAPE reactivity allow us to improve thermodynamic structure predictions of riboSNitches. This is significant, as accurate RNA structural analysis and prediction is likely to become an important aspect of precision medicine.

Here we simultaneously analyze both parameters in detail with respect to the occurrence of N-1-methyladenosine (m1A) in the template RNA. This naturally occurring modification is associated with structural effects, but it is also known as a mediator of antibiotic resistance in ribosomal RNA. In structural probing experiments with dimethylsulfate, m1A is routinely detected by RT-arrest. A specifically developed RNA-Seq protocol was tailored to the simultaneous analysis of RT-arrest and misincorporation patterns. By application to a variety of native and synthetic RNA preparations, we found a characteristic signature of m1A, which, in addition to an arrest rate, features misincorporation as a significant component. Detailed analysis suggests that the signature depends on RNA structure and on the nature of the nucleotide 3{\^{a}}€² of m1A in the template RNA, meaning it is sequence dependent. The RT-signature of m1A was used for inspection and confirmation of suspected modification sites and resulted in the identification of hitherto unknown m1A residues in trypanosomal tRNA.},

Despite concurrent advances in quality and quantity of data as well as computing resources and algorithms, difficulties in deciphering direct and indirect network connections are prevalent. Here, we adopt the notions of abstraction, emulation, benchmarking, and validation in the context of discovering features specific to this family of connectivities. After subjecting benchmark synthetic circuits to perturbations, we inferred the network connections using a combination of nonparametric single-cell data resampling and modular response analysis. Intriguingly, we discovered that recovered weights of specific network edges undergo divergent shifts under differential perturbations, and that the particular behavior is markedly different between topologies. Our results point to a conceptual advance for reverse engineering beyond weight inference. Investigating topological changes under differential perturbations may address the longstanding problem of discriminating direct and indirect connectivities in biological networks.},

Parametric sensitivities are often calculated using Monte Carlo techniques that are typically computationally expensive; however, variance reduction techniques can decrease the number of Monte Carlo simulations required. By exploiting the characteristic dynamics of spatially-extended reaction networks, we are able to adapt existing finite difference schemes to robustly estimate parametric sensitivities in a spatially-extended network. We show that algorithmic performance depends on the dynamics of the given network and the choice of summary statistics. We then describe a hybrid technique that dynamically chooses the most appropriate simulation method for the network of interest.

abstract = {Genetic sequence data on pathogens have great potential to inform inference of their transmission dynamics ultimately leading to better disease control. Where genetic change and disease transmission occur on comparable timescales additional information can be inferred via the joint analysis of such genetic sequence data and epidemiological observations based on clinical symptoms and diagnostic tests. Although recently introduced approaches represent substantial progress, for computational reasons they approximate genuine joint inference of disease dynamics and genetic change in the pathogen population, capturing partially the joint epidemiological-evolutionary dynamics. Improved methods are needed to fully integrate such genetic data with epidemiological observations, for achieving a more robust inference of the transmission tree and other key epidemiological parameters such as latent periods. Here, building on current literature, a novel Bayesian framework is proposed that infers simultaneously and explicitly the transmission tree and unobserved transmitted pathogen sequences. Our framework facilitates the use of realistic likelihood functions and enables systematic and genuine joint inference of the epidemiological-evolutionary process from partially observed outbreaks. Using simulated data it is shown that this approach is able to infer accurately joint epidemiological-evolutionary dynamics, even when pathogen sequences and epidemiological data are incomplete, and when sequences are available for only a fraction of exposures. These results also characterise and quantify the value of incomplete and partial sequence data, which has important implications for sampling design, and demonstrate the abilities of the introduced method to identify multiple clusters within an outbreak. The framework is used to analyse an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the UK, enhancing current understanding of its transmission dynamics and evolutionary process.},

Like a conventional computer, it can use its memory to represent and manipulate complex data structures, but, like a neural network, it can learn to do so from data. When trained with supervised learning, we demonstrate that a DNC can successfully answer synthetic questions designed to emulate reasoning and inference problems in natural language. We show that it can learn tasks such as finding the shortest path between specified points and inferring the missing links in randomly generated graphs, and then generalize these tasks to specific graphs such as transport networks and family trees. When trained with reinforcement learning, a DNC can complete a moving blocks puzzle in which changing goals are specified by sequences of symbols. Taken together, our results demonstrate that DNCs have the capacity to solve complex, structured tasks that are inaccessible to neural networks without external read-write memory.},

Results: We describe here a novel junction-centric method, jSplice, that enables de novo extraction of alternative splicing events from RNA-sequencing data with high accuracy, reliability, and speed. Application to clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) cell lines and 65 ccRCC patients revealed experimentally validatable alternative splicing changes and signatures able to prognosticate ccRCC outcome. In the aggregate, our results propose jSplice as a key analytic tool for the derivation of cell context-dependent alternative splicing patterns from large-scale RNA-sequencing datasets.

abstract = {Individual behavior, in biology, economics, and computer science, is often described in terms of balancing exploration and exploitation. Foraging has been a canonical setting for studying reward seeking and information gathering, from bacteria to humans, mostly focusing on individual behavior. Inspired by the gradient-climbing nature of chemotaxis, the infotaxis algorithm showed that locally maximizing the expected information gain leads to efficient and ethological individual foraging. In nature, as well as in theoretical settings, conspecifics can be a valuable source of information about the environment. Whereas the nature and role of interactions between animals have been studied extensively, the design principles of information processing in such groups are mostly unknown. We present an algorithm for group foraging, which we term "socialtaxis," that unifies infotaxis and social interactions, where each individual in the group simultaneously maximizes its own sensory information and a social information term. Surprisingly, we show that when individuals aim to increase their information diversity, efficient collective behavior emerges in groups of opportunistic agents, which is comparable to the optimal group behavior. Importantly, we show the high efficiency of biologically plausible socialtaxis settings, where agents share little or no information and rely on simple computations to infer information from the behavior of their conspecifics. Moreover, socialtaxis does not require parameter tuning and is highly robust to sensory and behavioral noise. We use socialtaxis to predict distinct optimal couplings in groups of selfish vs. altruistic agents, reflecting how it can be naturally extended to study social dynamics and collective computation in general settings.},

abstract = {The functions of proteins and RNAs are defined by the collective interactions of many residues, and yet most statistical models of biological sequences consider sites nearly independently. Recent approaches have demonstrated benefits of including interactions to capture pairwise covariation, but leave higher-order dependencies out of reach. Here we show how it is possible to capture higher-order, context-dependent constraints in biological sequences via latent variable models with nonlinear dependencies. We found that DeepSequence ( https://github.com/debbiemarkslab/DeepSequence ), a probabilistic model for sequence families, predicted the effects of mutations across a variety of deep mutational scanning experiments substantially better than existing methods based on the same evolutionary data. The model, learned in an unsupervised manner solely on the basis of sequence information, is grounded with biologically motivated priors, reveals the latent organization of sequence families, and can be used to explore new parts of sequence space.},

abstract = {Gene expression in individual cells is highly variable and sporadic, often resulting in the synthesis of mRNAs and proteins in bursts. Such bursting has important consequences for cell-fate decisions in diverse processes ranging from HIV-1 viral infections to stem-cell differentiation. It is generally assumed that bursts are geometrically distributed and that they arrive according to a Poisson process. On the other hand, recent single-cell experiments provide evidence for complex burst arrival processes, highlighting the need for analysis of more general stochastic models. To address this issue, we invoke a mapping between general stochastic models of gene expression and systems studied in queueing theory to derive exact analytical expressions for the moments associated with mRNA/protein steady-state distributions. These results are then used to derive noise signatures, i.e. explicit conditions based entirely on experimentally measurable quantities, that determine if the burst distributions deviate from the geometric distribution or if burst arrival deviates from a Poisson process. For non-Poisson arrivals, we develop approaches for accurate estimation of burst parameters. The proposed approaches can lead to new insights into transcriptional bursting based on measurements of steady-state mRNA/protein distributions.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Because of the advantages of RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) over microarrays, it is gaining widespread popularity for highly parallel gene expression analysis. For example, RNA-Seq is expected to be able to provide accurate identification and quantification of full-length splice forms. A number of informatics packages have been developed for this purpose, but short reads make it a difficult problem in principle. Sequencing error and polymorphisms add further complications. It has become necessary to perform studies to determine which algorithms perform best and which if any algorithms perform adequately. However, there is a dearth of independent and unbiased benchmarking studies. Here we take an approach using both simulated and experimental benchmark data to evaluate their accuracy. RESULTS: We conclude that most methods are inaccurate even using idealized data, and that no method is highly accurate once multiple splice forms, polymorphisms, intron signal, sequencing errors, alignment errors, annotation errors and other complicating factors are present. These results point to the pressing need for further algorithm development.

abstract = {Atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of protein molecules are too computationally expensive to predict most native structures from amino acid sequences. Here, we integrate "weak" external knowledge into folding simulations to predict protein structures, given their sequence. For example, we instruct the computer "to form a hydrophobic core," "to form good secondary structures," or "to seek a compact state." This kind of information has been too combinatoric, nonspecific, and vague to help guide MD simulations before. Within atomistic replica-exchange molecular dynamics (REMD), we develop a statistical mechanical framework, modeling using limited data with coarse physical insight(s) (MELD + CPI), for harnessing weak information. As a test, we apply MELD + CPI to predict the native structures of 20 small proteins. MELD + CPI samples to within less than 3.2 A from native for all 20 and correctly chooses the native structures ({\textless}4 A) for 15 of them, including ubiquitin, a millisecond folder. MELD + CPI is up to five orders of magnitude faster than brute-force MD, satisfies detailed balance, and should scale well to larger proteins. MELD + CPI may be useful where physics-based simulations are needed to study protein mechanisms and populations and where we have some heuristic or coarse physical knowledge about states of interest.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Understanding the regulation of gene expression, including transcription start site usage, alternative splicing, and polyadenylation, requires accurate quantification of expression levels down to the level of individual transcript isoforms. To comparatively evaluate the accuracy of the many methods that have been proposed for estimating transcript isoform abundance from RNA sequencing data, we have used both synthetic data as well as an independent experimental method for quantifying the abundance of transcript ends at the genome-wide level.RESULTS:We found that many tools have good accuracy and yield better estimates of gene-level expression compared to commonly used count-based approaches, but they vary widely in memory and runtime requirements. Nucleotide composition and intron/exon structure have comparatively little influence on the accuracy of expression estimates, which correlates most strongly with transcript/gene expression levels. To facilitate the reproduction and further extension of our study, we provide datasets, source code, and an online analysis tool on a companion website, where developers can upload expression estimates obtained with their own tool to compare them to those inferred by the methods assessed here.CONCLUSIONS:As many methods for quantifying isoform abundance with comparable accuracy are available, a user's choice will likely be determined by factors such as the memory and runtime requirements, as well as the availability of methods for downstream analyses. Sequencing-based methods to quantify the abundance of specific transcript regions could complement validation schemes based on synthetic data and quantitative PCR in future or ongoing assessments of RNA-seq analysis methods.},

Why is that people are selfless and often incur costs to aid others? Reputations are intimately linked with the answer to this question, and so are the social norms that dictate what is reckoned as a good or a bad action. Here we present a mathematical framework to analyze the relationship between different social norms and the sustainability of cooperation, in populations of arbitrary sizes. Indeed, it is known that cooperation, norms, reciprocity and the art of managing reputations, are features that go along with humans from their pre-historic existence in small-scale societies to the contemporary times, when technology supports the interaction with a large number of people. We show that population size is relevant when evaluating the merits of each social norm and conclude that there is a social norm especially effective in leveraging cooperation in small populations. That simple norm dictates that only whoever cooperates with good individuals, and defects against bad ones, deserves a good reputation.},

However, the molecular mechanisms underlying photoperiodic timing are largely unknown. The wasp Nasonia vitripennis is an emerging model organism that exhibits a strong photoperiodic response: Short autumnal days experienced by females lead to the induction of developmental arrest (diapause) in their progeny, allowing winter survival of the larvae. How female Nasonia control the developmental trajectory of their offspring is unclear. Here, we took advantage of the recent discovery that DNA methylation is pervasive in Nasonia and tested its role in photoperiodism. We used reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) to profile DNA methylation in adult female wasps subjected to different photoperiods and identified substantial differential methylation at the single base level. We also show that knocking down DNA methyltransferase 1a (Dnmt1a), Dnmt3, or blocking DNA methylation pharmacologically, largely disrupts the photoperiodic diapause response of the wasps. To our knowledge, this is the first example for a role of DNA methylation in insect photoperiodic timing.},

This riboregulatory activity causes pervasive changes in coding and noncoding transcripts of the host. Interspecies correlation analysis links PinT to host cell JAK-STAT signalling, and we identify infection-specific alterations in multiple long noncoding RNAs.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Differential transcript expression (DTE) analysis without predefined conditions is critical to biological studies. For example, it can be used to discover biomarkers to classify cancer samples into previously unknown subtypes such that better diagnosis and therapy methods can be developed for the subtypes. Although several DTE tools for population data, i.e. data without known biological conditions, have been published, these tools either assume binary conditions in the input population or require the number of conditions as a part of the input. Fixing the number of conditions to binary is unrealistic and may distort the results of a DTE analysis. Estimating the correct number of conditions in a population could also be challenging for a routine user. Moreover, the existing tools only provide differential usages of exons, which may be insufficient to interpret the patterns of alternative splicing across samples and restrains the applications of the tools from many biology studies.
RESULTS: We propose a novel DTE analysis algorithm, called SDEAP, that estimates the number of conditions directly from the input samples using a Dirichlet mixture model and discovers alternative splicing events using a new graph modular decomposition algorithm. By taking advantage of the above technical improvement, SDEAP was able to outperform the other DTE analysis methods in our extensive experiments on simulated data and real data with qPCR validation. The prediction of SDEAP also allowed us to classify the samples of cancer subtypes and cell-cycle phases more accurately.

Specifically, we estimated the kinetic parameters for the synthesis and degradation of RNA and proteins, and deconvoluted the response patterns into common and unique to each regulatory level using a new statistical tool. Overall, the two regulatory levels were equally important, but differed in their impact on molecule concentrations. Both mRNA and protein changes peaked between two and eight hours, but mRNA expression fold changes were much smaller than those of the proteins. mRNA concentrations shifted in a transient, pulse-like pattern and returned to values close to pre-treatment levels by the end of the experiment. In contrast, protein concentrations switched only once and established a new steady state, consistent with the dominant role of protein regulation during misfolding stress. Finally, we generated hypotheses on specific regulatory modes for some genes.},

abstract = {Studies of individual living cells have revealed that many transcription factors activate in dynamic, and often stochastic, pulses within the same cell. However, it has remained unclear whether cells might exploit the dynamic interaction of these pulses to control gene expression. Here, using quantitative single-cell time-lapse imaging of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we show that the pulsatile transcription factors Msn2 and Mig1 combinatorially regulate their target genes through modulation of their relative pulse timing. The activator Msn2 and repressor Mig1 showed pulsed activation in either a temporally overlapping or non-overlapping manner during their transient response to different inputs, with only the non-overlapping dynamics efficiently activating target gene expression. Similarly, under constant environmental conditions, where Msn2 and Mig1 exhibit sporadic pulsing, glucose concentration modulated the temporal overlap between pulses of the two factors. Together, these results reveal a time-based mode of combinatorial gene regulation. Regulation through relative signal timing is common in engineering and neurobiology, and these results suggest that it could also function broadly within the signalling and regulatory systems of the cell.},

abstract = {Applying standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms to large data sets is computationally infeasible. The recently proposed stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD) method circumvents this problem in three ways: it generates proposed moves using only a subset of the data, it skips the Metropolis- Hastings accept-reject step, and it uses sequences of decreasing step sizes. In Teh et al. (2014), we provided the mathematical foundations for the decreasing step size SGLD, including consistency and a central limit theorem. However, in practice the SGLD is run for a relatively small number of iterations, and its step size is not decreased to zero. The present article investigates the behaviour of the SGLD with fixed step size. In particular we characterise the asymptotic bias explicitly, along with its dependence on the step size and the variance of the stochastic gradient. On that basis a modified SGLD which removes the asymptotic bias due to the variance of the stochastic gradients up to first order in the step size is derived. Moreover, we are able to obtain bounds on the finite-time bias, variance and mean squared error (MSE). The theory is illustrated with a Gaussian toy model for which the bias and the MSE for the estimation of moments can be obtained explicitly. For this toy model we study the gain of the SGLD over the standard Euler method in the limit of large data sets.},

Here we found that epicardial cells contain a potent cardiogenic activity identified as follistatin-like 1 (Fstl1). Epicardial Fstl1 declines following myocardial infarction and is replaced by myocardial expression. Myocardial Fstl1 does not promote regeneration, either basally or upon transgenic overexpression. Application of the human Fstl1 protein (FSTL1) via an epicardial patch stimulates cell cycle entry and division of pre-existing cardiomyocytes, improving cardiac function and survival in mouse and swine models of myocardial infarction. The data suggest that the loss of epicardial FSTL1 is a maladaptive response to injury, and that its restoration would be an effective way to reverse myocardial death and remodelling following myocardial infarction in humans.},

Here we present a CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system that combines Cas9 ribonucleoproteins and adeno-associated viral vector delivery of a homologous donor to achieve homologous recombination at the HBB gene in haematopoietic stem cells. Notably, we devise an enrichment model to purify a population of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells with more than 90{\%} targeted integration. We also show efficient correction of the Glu6Val mutation responsible for sickle cell disease by using patient-derived stem and progenitor cells that, after differentiation into erythrocytes, express adult $\beta$-globin (HbA) messenger RNA, which confirms intact transcriptional regulation of edited HBB alleles. Collectively, these preclinical studies outline a CRISPR-based methodology for targeting haematopoietic stem cells by homologous recombination at the HBB locus to advance the development of next-generation therapies for $\beta$-haemoglobinopathies.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Information about RNA-protein interactions is a vital pre-requisite to tackle the dissection of RNA regulatory processes. Despite the recent advances of the experimental techniques, the currently available RNA interactome involves a small portion of the known RNA binding proteins. The importance of determining RNA-protein interactions, coupled with the scarcity of the available information, calls for in silico prediction of such interactions.
RESULTS: We present RNAcommender, a recommender system capable of suggesting RNA targets to unexplored RNA binding proteins, by propagating the available interaction information taking into account the protein domain composition and the RNA predicted secondary structure. Our results show that RNAcommender is able to successfully suggest RNA interactors for RNA binding proteins using little or no interaction evidence. RNAcommender was tested on a large dataset of human RBP-RNA interactions, showing a good ranking performance (average AUC ROC of 0.75) and significant enrichment of correct recommendations for 75{\%} of the tested RBPs. RNAcommender can be a valid tool to assist researchers in identifying potential interacting candidates for the majority of RBPs with uncharacterized binding preferences.

abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling is an important and commonly used tool for the analysis of hierarchical models. Nevertheless, practitioners generally have two options for MCMC: utilize existing software that generates a black-box “one size fits all" algorithm, or the challenging (and time consuming) task of implementing a problem-specific MCMC algorithm. Either choice may result in inefficient sampling, and hence researchers have become accustomed to MCMC runtimes on the order of days (or longer) for large models. We propose an automated procedure to determine an efficient MCMC block-sampling algorithm for a given model and computing platform. Our procedure dynamically determines blocks of parameters for joint sampling that result in efficient MCMC sampling of the entire model. We test this procedure using a diverse suite of example models, and observe non-trivial improvements in MCMC efficiency for many models. Our procedure is the first attempt at such, and may be generalized to a broader space of MCMC algorithms. Our results suggest that substantive improvements in MCMC efficiency may be practically realized using our automated blocking procedure, or variants thereof, which warrants additional study and application.},

abstract = {Epigenetic mechanisms have emerged as links between prenatal environmental exposure and disease risk later in life. Here, we studied epigenetic changes associated with maternal smoking at base pair resolution by mappingDNAmethylation, histone modifications, and transcription in expectant mothers and their newborn children. We found extensive global differential methylation and carefully evaluated these changes to separate environment associated from genotype-relatedDNAmethylation changes. Differential methylation is enriched in enhancer elements and targets in particular "commuting" enhancers having multiple, regulatory interactions with distal genes. Longitudinal whole-genome bisulfite sequencing revealed thatDNAmethylation changes associated with maternal smoking persist over years of life. Particularly in children prenatal environmental exposure leads to chromatin transitions into a hyperactive state. CombinedDNAmethylation, histone modification, and gene expression analyses indicate that differential methylation in enhancer regions is more often functionally translated than methylation changes in promoters or non-regulatory elements. Finally, we show that epigenetic deregulation of a commuting enhancer targeting c-Jun N-terminal kinase 2 (JNK2) is linked to impaired lung function in early childhood.},

abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Bell proved that no theory of nature that obeys locality and realism can reproduce all the predictions of quantum theory: in any local-realist theory, the correlations between outcomes of measurements on distant particles satisfy an inequality that can be violated if the particles are entangled. Numerous Bell inequality tests have been reported; however, all experiments reported so far required additional assumptions to obtain a contradiction with local realism, resulting in 'loopholes'. Here we report a Bell experiment that is free of any such additional assumption and thus directly tests the principles underlying Bell's inequality. We use an event-ready scheme that enables the generation of robust entanglement between distant electron spins (estimated state fidelity of 0.92 +/- 0.03). Efficient spin read-out avoids the fair-sampling assumption (detection loophole), while the use of fast random-basis selection and spin read-out combined with a spatial separation of 1.3 kilometres ensure the required locality conditions. We performed 245 trials that tested the CHSH-Bell inequality S {\textless}/= 2 and found S = 2.42 +/- 0.20 (where S quantifies the correlation between measurement outcomes). A null-hypothesis test yields a probability of at most P = 0.039 that a local-realist model for space-like separated sites could produce data with a violation at least as large as we observe, even when allowing for memory in the devices. Our data hence imply statistically significant rejection of the local-realist null hypothesis. This conclusion may be further consolidated in future experiments; for instance, reaching a value of P = 0.001 would require approximately 700 trials for an observed S = 2.4. With improvements, our experiment could be used for testing less-conventional theories, and for implementing device-independent quantum-secure communication and randomness certification.},

abstract = {The Gaussian process latent variable model (GP-LVM) provides a flexible approach for non-linear dimensionality reduction that has been widely applied. However, the current approach for training GP-LVMs is based on maximum likelihood, where the latent projection variables are maximised over rather than integrated out. In this paper we present a Bayesian method for training GP-LVMs by introducing a non-standard variational inference framework that allows to approximately integrate out the latent variables and subsequently train a GP-LVM by maximising an analytic lower bound on the exact marginal likelihood. We apply this method for learning a GP-LVM from i.i.d. observations and for learning non-linear dynamical systems where the observations are temporally correlated. We show that a benefit of the variational Bayesian procedure is its robustness to overfitting and its ability to automatically select the dimensionality of the non-linear latent space. The resulting framework is generic, flexible and easy to extend for other purposes, such as Gaussian process regression with uncertain or partially missing inputs. We demonstrate our method on synthetic data and standard machine learning benchmarks, as well as challenging real world datasets, including high resolution video data.},

abstract = {Motivation: Understanding the occurrence and regulation of alternative splicing (AS) is a key task towards explaining the regulatory processes that shape the complex transcriptomes of higher eukaryotes. With the advent of high-throughput sequencing of RNA (RNA-Seq), the diversity of AS transcripts could be measured at an unprecedented depth. Although the catalog of known AS events has grown ever since, novel transcripts are commonly observed when working with less well annotated organisms, in the context of disease, or within large populations. Whereas an identification of complete transcripts is technically challenging and computationally expensive, focusing on single splicing events as a proxy for transcriptome characteristics is fruitful and sufficient for a wide range of analyses.

Results: We present SplAdder, an alternative splicing toolbox, that takes RNA-Seq alignments and an annotation file as input to i) augment the annotation based on RNA-Seq evidence, ii) identify alternative splicing events present in the augmented annotation graph, iii) quantify and confirm these events based on the RNA-Seq data, and iv) test for significant quantitative differences between samples. Thereby, our main focus lies on performance, accuracy and usability.

abstract = {The heterogeneity in mammalian cells signaling response is largely a result of pre-existing cell-to-cell variability. It is unknown whether cell-to-cell variability rises from biochemical stochastic fluctuations or distinct cellular states. Here, we utilize calcium response to adenosine trisphosphate as a model for investigating the structure of heterogeneity within a population of cells and analyze whether distinct cellular response states coexist. We use a functional definition of cellular state that is based on a mechanistic dynamical systems model of calcium signaling. Using Bayesian parameter inference, we obtain high confidence parameter value distributions for several hundred cells, each fitted individually. Clustering the inferred parameter distributions revealed three major distinct cellular states within the population. The existence of distinct cellular states raises the possibility that the observed variability in response is a result of structured heterogeneity between cells. The inferred parameter distribution predicts, and experiments confirm that variability in IP3R response explains the majority of calcium heterogeneity.

Here, we derive new bounds on the likelihood that observations of single-cell, single-molecule responses come from a discrete stochastic model, posed in the form of the chemical master equation. These strict upper and lower bounds are based on a finite state projection approach, and they converge monotonically to the exact likelihood value. These bounds allow one to discriminate rigorously between models and with a minimum level of computational effort. In practice, these bounds can be incorporated into stochastic model identification and parameter inference routines, which improve the accuracy and efficiency of endeavors to analyze and predict single-cell behavior.

Furthermore, they coincide with house-keeping gene promoters and the associated genes are stably expressed across multiple cell types. Despite these features, HOT regions are solemnly defined using ChIP-seq experiments and shown to lack canonical motifs for transcription factors that are thought to be bound there. Although, ChIP-seq experiments are the golden standard for finding genome-wide binding sites of a protein, they are not noise free.

We observe sequence characteristics and genomic features that are discriminatory of HOT regions, such as GC/CpG-rich k-mers and enrichment of RNA-DNA hybrids (R-loops) and DNA tertiary structures (G-quadruplex DNA). The artificial ChIP-seq enrichment on HOT regions could be associated to these discriminatory features.

Recently, a nanopore-based sequencing instrument, the Oxford Nanopore MinION, has become available, and we used this for sequencing the Saccharomyces cerevisiae genome. To make use of these data, we developed a novel open-source hybrid error correction algorithm Nanocorr specifically for Oxford Nanopore reads, because existing packages were incapable of assembling the long read lengths (5–50 kbp) at such high error rates (between ∼5{\%} and 40{\%} error). With this new method, we were able to perform a hybrid error correction of the nanopore reads using complementary MiSeq data and produce a de novo assembly that is highly contiguous and accurate: The contig N50 length is more than ten times greater than an Illumina-only assembly (678 kb versus 59.9 kbp) and has {\textgreater}99.88{\%} consensus identity when compared to the reference. Furthermore, the assembly with the long nanopore reads presents a much more complete representation of the features of the genome and correctly assembles gene cassettes, rRNAs, transposable elements, and other genomic features that were almost entirely absent in the Illumina-only assembly.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) methods provide an elaborate approach to Bayesian inference on complex models, including model choice. Both theoretical arguments and simulation experiments indicate, however, that model posterior probabilities may be poorly evaluated by standard ABC techniques. RESULTS: We propose a novel approach based on a machine learning tool named random forests to conduct selection among the highly complex models covered by ABC algorithms. We thus modify the way Bayesian model selection is both understood and operated, in that we rephrase the inferential goal as a classification problem, first predicting the model that best fits the data with random forests and postponing the approximation of the posterior probability of the predicted MAP for a second stage also relying on random forests. Compared with earlier implementations of ABC model choice, the ABC random forest approach offers several potential improvements: (i) it often has a larger discriminative power among the competing models, (ii) it is more robust against the number and choice of statistics summarizing the data, (iii) the computing effort is drastically reduced (with a gain in computation efficiency of at least fifty), and (iv) it includes an approximation of the posterior probability of the selected model. The call to random forests will undoubtedly extend the range of size of datasets and complexity of models that ABC can handle. We illustrate the power of this novel methodology by analyzing controlled experiments as well as genuine population genetics datasets. AVAILABILITY: The proposed methodologies are implemented in the R package abcrf available on the CRAN. CONTACT: jean-michel.marin@umontpellier.fr.},

Theoretical research has shown how neural networks can operate at different dynamic ranges that correspond to specific types of information processing. Here we present a data analysis framework that uses a linearized model of these dynamic states in order to decompose the measured neural signal into a series of components that capture both rhythmic and non-rhythmic neural activity. The method is based on stochastic differential equations and Gaussian process regression. Through computer simulations and analysis of magnetoencephalographic data, we demonstrate the efficacy of the method in identifying meaningful modulations of oscillatory signals corrupted by structured temporal and spatiotemporal noise. These results suggest that the method is particularly suitable for the analysis and interpretation of complex temporal and spatiotemporal neural signals.},

abstract = {Signal transduction networks allow eukaryotic cells to make decisions based on information about intracellular state and the environment. Biochemical noise significantly diminishes the fidelity of signaling: networks examined to date seem to transmit less than 1 bit of information. It is unclear how networks that control critical cell-fate decisions (e.g., cell division and apoptosis) can function with such low levels of information transfer. Here, we use theory, experiments, and numerical analysis to demonstrate an inherent trade-off between the information transferred in individual cells and the information available to control population-level responses. Noise in receptor-mediated apoptosis reduces information transfer to approximately 1 bit at the single-cell level but allows 3-4 bits of information to be transmitted at the population level. For processes such as eukaryotic chemotaxis, in which single cells are the functional unit, we find high levels of information transmission at a single-cell level. Thus, low levels of information transfer are unlikely to represent a physical limit. Instead, we propose that signaling networks exploit noise at the single-cell level to increase population-level information transfer, allowing extracellular ligands, whose levels are also subject to noise, to incrementally regulate phenotypic changes. This is particularly critical for discrete changes in fate (e.g., life vs. death) for which the key variable is the fraction of cells engaged. Our findings provide a framework for rationalizing the high levels of noise in metazoan signaling networks and have implications for the development of drugs that target these networks in the treatment of cancer and other diseases.},

Alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT) necessitates homology-directed DNA repair to maintain telomeres in about 10-15{\%} of human cancers. How DNA damage induces assembly and execution of a DNA replication complex (break-induced replisome) at telomeres or elsewhere in the mammalian genome is poorly understood. Here we define break-induced telomere synthesis and demonstrate that it utilizes a specialized replisome, which underlies ALT telomere maintenance. DNA double-strand breaks enact nascent telomere synthesis by long-tract unidirectional replication. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) loading by replication factor C (RFC) acts as the initial sensor of telomere damage to establish predominance of DNA polymerase $\delta$ (Pol $\delta$) through its POLD3 subunit. Break-induced telomere synthesis requires the RFC-PCNA-Pol $\delta$ axis, but is independent of other canonical replisome components, ATM and ATR, or the homologous recombination protein Rad51. Thus, the inception of telomere damage recognition by the break-induced replisome orchestrates homology-directed telomere maintenance.},

We further generalize the algorithm by Dieker {\&} Mikosch (2015) for Brown–Resnick processes and use it for exact simulation via the spectral measure. We study the complexity of both algorithms, prove that our new approach via extremal functions is always more efficient, and provide closed-form expressions for their implementation that cover most popular models for max-stable processes and multivariate extreme value distributions. For simulation on dense grids, an adaptive design of the extremal function algorithm is proposed.},

Here we describe the shotgun-sequencing of ancient DNA from five specimens of Neanderthal calcified dental plaque (calculus) and the characterization of regional differences in Neanderthal ecology. At Spy cave, Belgium, Neanderthal diet was heavily meat based and included woolly rhinoceros and wild sheep (mouflon), characteristic of a steppe environment. In contrast, no meat was detected in the diet of Neanderthals from El Sidr{\{}{\'{o}}{\}}n cave, Spain, and dietary components of mushrooms, pine nuts, and moss reflected forest gathering. Differences in diet were also linked to an overall shift in the oral bacterial community (microbiota) and suggested that meat consumption contributed to substantial variation within Neanderthal microbiota. Evidence for self-medication was detected in an El Sidr{\{}{\'{o}}{\}}n Neanderthal with a dental abscess and a chronic gastrointestinal pathogen (Enterocytozoon bieneusi). Metagenomic data from this individual also contained a nearly complete genome of the archaeal commensal Methanobrevibacter oralis (10.2× depth of coverage)-the oldest draft microbial genome generated to date, at around 48,000 years old. DNA preserved within dental calculus represents a notable source of information about the behaviour and health of ancient hominin specimens, as well as a unique system that is useful for the study of long-term microbial evolution.},

abstract = {Statistical inference problems arising within signal processing, data mining, and machine learning naturally give rise to hard combinatorial optimization problems. These problems become intractable when the dimensionality of the data is large, as is often the case for modern datasets. A popular idea is to construct convex relaxations of these combinatorial problems, which can be solved efficiently for large-scale datasets. Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations are among the most powerful methods in this family and are surprisingly well suited for a broad range of problems where data take the form of matrices or graphs. It has been observed several times that when the statistical noise is small enough, SDP relaxations correctly detect the underlying combinatorial structures. In this paper we develop asymptotic predictions for several detection thresholds, as well as for the estimation error above these thresholds. We study some classical SDP relaxations for statistical problems motivated by graph synchronization and community detection in networks. We map these optimization problems to statistical mechanics models with vector spins and use nonrigorous techniques from statistical mechanics to characterize the corresponding phase transitions. Our results clarify the effectiveness of SDP relaxations in solving high-dimensional statistical problems.},

abstract = {Many Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques currently available rely on discrete-time reversible Markov processes whose transition kernels are variations of the Metropolis{\^{a}}€“Hastings algorithm. We explore and generalize an alternative scheme recently introduced in the physics literature [22] where the target distribution is explored using a continuous-time non-reversible piecewise-deterministic Markov process. In the Metropolis{\^{a}}€“Hastings algorithm, a trial move to a region of lower target density, equivalently of higher {\^{a}}€{\oe}energy{\^{a}}€, than the current state can be rejected with positive probability. In this alternative approach, a particle moves along straight lines around the space and, when facing a high energy barrier, it is not rejected but its path is modified by bouncing against this barrier. By reformulating this algorithm using inhomogeneous Poisson processes, we exploit standard sampling techniques to simulate exactly this Markov process in a wide range of scenarios of interest. Additionally, when the target distribution is given by a product of factors dependent only on subsets of the state variables, such as the posterior distribution associated with a probabilistic graphical model, this method can be modified to take advantage of this structure by allowing computationally cheaper {\^{a}}€{\oe}local{\^{a}}€ bounces which only involve the state variables associated to a factor, while the other state variables keep on evolving. In this context, by leveraging techniques from chemical kinetics, we propose several computationally efficient implementations. Experimentally, this new class of Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods on various Bayesian inference tasks, including for high dimensional models and large data sets. },

Here, we use dual trap optical tweezers to study single yeast RNA polymerase II (Pol II) molecules transcribing along a DNA template with two nucleosomes. The slowdown and the changes in pausing behavior within the nucleosomal region allow us to determine a drift coefficient, $\chi$, which characterizes the ability of the enzyme to recover from a nucleosomal backtrack. Notably, $\chi$ can be used to predict the probability to pass the first nucleosome. Importantly, the presence of a second nucleosome changes $\chi$ in a manner that depends on the spacing between the two nucleosomes, as well as on their rotational arrangement on the helical DNA molecule. Our results indicate that the ability of Pol II to pass the first nucleosome is increased when the next nucleosome is turned away from the first one to face the opposite side of the DNA template.

Parameter estimation in nonlinear dynamic models remains a very challenging inverse problem due to its nonconvexity and ill-conditioning. Associated issues like overfitting and local solutions are usually not properly addressed in the systems biology literature despite their importance.Here we present a method for robust and efficient parameter estimation which uses two main strategies to surmount the aforementioned difficulties: (i) efficient global optimization to deal with nonconvexity, and (ii) proper regularization methods to handle ill-conditioning. In the case of regularization, we present a detailed critical comparison of methods and guidelines for properly tuning them. Further, we show how regularized estimations ensure the best trade-offs between bias and variance, reducing overfitting, and allowing the incorporation of prior knowledge in a systematic way.RESULTS:We illustrate the performance of the presented method with seven case studies of different nature and increasing complexity, considering several scenarios of data availability, measurement noise and prior knowledge. We show how our method ensures improved estimations with faster and more stable convergence. We also show how the calibrated models are more generalizable. Finally, we give a set of simple guidelines to apply this strategy to a wide variety of calibration problems.CONCLUSIONS:Here we provide a parameter estimation strategy which combines efficient global optimization with a regularization scheme.

abstract = {The process of cell fate determination has been depicted intuitively as cells travelling and resting on a rugged landscape, which has been probed by various theoretical studies. However, few studies have experimentally demonstrated how underlying gene regulatory networks shape the landscape and hence orchestrate cellular decision-making in the presence of both signal and noise. Here we tested different topologies and verified a synthetic gene circuit with mutual inhibition and auto-activations to be quadrastable, which enables direct study of quadruple cell fate determination on an engineered landscape. We show that cells indeed gravitate towards local minima and signal inductions dictate cell fates through modulating the shape of the multistable landscape. Experiments, guided by model predictions, reveal that sequential inductions generate distinct cell fates by changing landscape in sequence and hence navigating cells to different final states. This work provides a synthetic biology framework to approach cell fate determination and suggests a landscape-based explanation of fixed induction sequences for targeted differentiation.},

abstract = {Chromatin is composed of DNA and histones, which provide a unified platform for regulating DNA-related processes, mostly through their post translational modification. During DNA replication, histone arrangement is perturbed, to first allow progression of DNA polymerase and then during repackaging of the replicated DNA. To study how DNA replication influences the pattern of histone modification, we followed the cell-cycle dynamics of ten histone marks in budding yeast. We find that histones deposited on newly replicated DNA are modified at different rates; while some marks appear immediately upon replication (e.g. H4K16ac, H3K4me1), others increase with transcription-dependent delays (e.g. H3K4me3, H3K36me3). Notably, H3K9ac was deposited as a wave preceding the replication fork by {\~{}}5-6 kb. This replication-guided H3K9ac was fully dependent on the acetyltransferase Rtt109, while expression-guided H3K9ac was deposited by Gcn5. Further, topoisomerase depletion intensified H3K9ac in front of the replication fork, and in sites where RNA polymerase II was trapped, suggesting supercoiling stresses trigger H3K9 acetylation. Our results assign complementary roles for DNA replication and gene expression in defining the pattern of histone modification.},

abstract = {The widespread view of bacteria as strictly pathogenic has given way to an appreciation of the prevalence of some beneficial microbes within the human body. It is perhaps inevitable that some bacteria would evolve to preferentially grow in environments that harbor disease and thus provide a natural platform for the development of engineered therapies. Such therapies could benefit from bacteria that are programmed to limit bacterial growth while continually producing and releasing cytotoxic agents in situ. Here we engineer a clinically relevant bacterium to lyse synchronously ata threshold population density and to release genetically encoded cargo. Following quorum lysis, a small number of surviving bacteria reseed the growing population, thus leading to pulsatile delivery cycles. We used microfluidic devices to characterize the engineered lysis strain and we demonstrate its potential as a drug delivery platform via co-culture with human cancer cells in vitro. Asa proof of principle, we tracked the bacterial population dynamics in ectopic syngeneic colorectal tumours in mice via a luminescent reporter. The lysis strain exhibits pulsatile population dynamics in vivo, with mean bacterial luminescence that remained two orders of magnitude lower than an unmodified strain. Finally, guided by previous findings that certain bacteria can enhance the efficacy of standard therapies, we orally administered the lysis strain alone or in combination with a clinical chemotherapeutic to a syngeneic mouse transplantation model of hepatic colorectal metastases. We found that the combination of both circuit-engineered bacteria and chemotherapy leads to a notable reduction of tumour activity along with a marked survival benefit over either therapy alone.Our approach establishes a methodology for leveraging the tools of synthetic biology to exploit the natural propensity for certain bacteria to colonize disease sites.},

abstract = {Motivation: One of the main goals of large scale methylation studies is to detect differentially methylated loci. One way is to approach this problem sitewise, i.e. to find differentially methylated positions (DMPs). However, it has been shown that methylation is regulated in longer genomic regions. So it is more desirable to identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) instead of DMPs. The new high coverage arrays, like Illuminas 450k platform, make it possible at a reasonable cost. Few tools exist for DMR identification from this type of data, but there is no standard approach.
Results: We propose a novel method for DMR identification that detects the region boundaries according to the minimum description length (MDL) principle, essentially solving the problem of model selection. The significance of the regions is established using linear mixed models. Using both simulated and large publicly available methylation datasets, we compare seqlm performance to alternative approaches. We demonstrate that it is both more sensitive and specific than competing methods. This is achieved with minimal parameter tuning and, surprisingly, quickest running time of all the tried methods. Finally, we show that the regional differential methylation patterns identified on sparse array data are confirmed by higher resolution sequencing approaches.

abstract = {Flexible adaptation to environmental stress is vital for bacteria. An energy-efficient post-transcriptional stress response mechanism in Escherichia coli is governed by the toxin MazF. After stress-induced activation the endoribonuclease MazF processes a distinct subset of transcripts as well as the 16S ribosomal RNA in the context of mature ribosomes. As these ‘stress-ribosomes' are specific for the MazF-processed mRNAs, the translational program is changed. To identify this ‘MazF-regulon' we employed Poly-seq (polysome fractionation coupled with RNA-seq analysis) and analyzed alterations introduced into the transcriptome and translatome after mazF overexpression. Unexpectedly, our results reveal that the corresponding protein products are involved in all cellular processes and do not particularly contribute to the general stress response. Moreover, our findings suggest that translational reprogramming serves as a fast-track reaction to harsh stress and highlight the so far underestimated significance of selective translation as a global regulatory mechanism in gene expression. Considering the reported implication of toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems in persistence, our results indicate that MazF acts as a prime effector during harsh stress that potentially introduces translational heterogeneity within a bacterial population thereby stimulating persister cell formation.},

abstract = {A complex disease generally results not from malfunction of individual molecules but from dysfunction of the relevant system or network, which dynamically changes with time and conditions. Thus, estimating a condition-specific network from a single sample is crucial to elucidating the molecular mechanisms of complex diseases at the system level. However, there is currently no effective way to construct such an individual-specific network by expression profiling of a single sample because of the requirement of multiple samples for computing correlations. We developed here with a statistical method, i.e. a sample-specific network (SSN) method, which allows us to construct individual-specific networks based on molecular expressions of a single sample. Using this method, we can characterize various human diseases at a network level. In particular, such SSNs can lead to the identification of individual-specific disease modules as well as driver genes, even without gene sequencing information. Extensive analysis by using the Cancer Genome Atlas data not only demonstrated the effectiveness of the method, but also found new individual-specific driver genes and network patterns for various types of cancer. Biological experiments on drug resistance further validated one important advantage of our method over the traditional methods, i.e. we can even identify such drug resistance genes that actually have no clear differential expression between samples with and without the resistance, due to the additional network information.},

abstract = {Fork in the road for immune cells
Immune cell differentiation along T helper pathways can profoundly influence the nature of the immune response{\^{a}}€”from promoting allergy to enhancing inflammation. L{\~{A}}{\P}nnberg et al. use single-cell transcriptomics and computational modeling to delineate the molecular cues that guide this decision. During blood-stage Plasmodium infection in mice, the authors track TH1/TFH bifurcation at both the population and single-clone levels and identify genes associated with each path. They demonstrate roles of particular cell types in shaping this decision. This approach provides a broad framework for modeling immune cell differentiation in vivo.
Differentiation of na{\~{A}}¯ve CD4+ T cells into functionally distinct T helper (TH) subsets is crucial for the orchestration of immune responses. Because of extensive heterogeneity and multiple overlapping transcriptional programs in differentiating T cell populations, this process has remained a challenge for systematic dissection in vivo. By using single-cell transcriptomics and computational analysis with a temporal mixtures of Gaussian processes model, termed GPfates, we reconstructed the developmental trajectories of TH1 and TFH (T follicular helper) cells during blood-stage Plasmodium infection in mice. By tracking clonality using endogenous T cell receptor sequences, we first demonstrated that TH1/TFH bifurcation had occurred at both population and single-clone levels. Next, we identified genes whose expression was associated with TH1 or TFH fates and demonstrated a T cell{\^{a}}€“intrinsic role for Galectin-1 in supporting TH1 differentiation. We also revealed the close molecular relationship between TH1 and interleukin-10{\^{a}}€“producing Tr1 cells in this infection. TH1 and TFH fates emerged from a highly proliferative precursor that up-regulated aerobic glycolysis and accelerated cell cycling as cytokine expression began. Dynamic gene expression of chemokine receptors around bifurcation predicted roles for cell-cell interaction in driving TH1/TFH fates. In particular, we found that precursor TH cells were coached toward a TH1 but not a TFH fate by inflammatory monocytes. Thus, by integrating genomic and computational approaches, our study has provided two unique resources: a database, www.PlasmoTH.org, which facilitates discovery of novel factors controlling TH1/TFH fate commitment, and, more generally, GPfates, a modeling framework for characterizing cell differentiation toward multiple fates.

abstract = {Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has improved the prospects for many individuals with diseases affecting motor control, and recently it has shown promise for improving cognitive function as well. Several studies in individuals with Alzheimer disease and in amnesic rats have demonstrated that DBS targeted to the fimbria-fornix, the region that appears to regulate hippocampal activity, can mitigate defects in hippocampus-dependent memory. Despite these promising results, DBS has not been tested for its ability to improve cognition in any childhood intellectual disability disorder. Such disorders are a pressing concern: they affect as much as 3{\%} of the population and involve hundreds of different genes. We proposed that stimulating the neural circuits that underlie learning and memory might provide a more promising route to treating these otherwise intractable disorders than seeking to adjust levels of one molecule at a time. We therefore studied the effects of forniceal DBS in a well-characterized mouse model of Rett syndrome (RTT), which is a leading cause of intellectual disability in females. Caused by mutations that impair the function of MeCP2 (ref. 6), RTT appears by the second year of life in humans, causing profound impairment in cognitive, motor and social skills, along with an array of neurological features. RTT mice, which reproduce the broad phenotype of this disorder, also show clear deficits in hippocampus-dependent learning and memory and hippocampal synaptic plasticity. Here we show that forniceal DBS in RTT mice rescues contextual fear memory as well as spatial learning and memory. In parallel, forniceal DBS restores in vivo hippocampal long-term potentiation and hippocampal neurogenesis. These results indicate that forniceal DBS might mitigate cognitive dysfunction in RTT.},

Although genome-wide mRNA-nucleoid segregation still lacks experimental validation, our model predicts that [Formula: see text] of mRNAs are segregated to the poles. In addition, our analysis reveals a "circulation" of ribosomes driven by the flux of mRNAs, from synthesis in the nucleoid to degradation at the poles. We show that our results are robust with respect to multiple, biologically relevant factors, such as mRNA degradation by RNase enzymes, different phases of the cell division cycle and growth rates, and the existence of nonspecific, transient interactions between ribosomes and mRNAs. Finally, we confirm that the observed nucleoid size stems from a balance between the forces that the chromosome and mRNAs exert on each other.

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Single-cell transcriptome data provide unprecedented resolution to study heterogeneity in cell populations and present a challenge for unsupervised classification. Popular methods, like principal component analysis (PCA), often suffer from the high level of noise in the data.
RESULTS: Here we adapt Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) to study the problem of identifying subpopulations in single-cell transcriptome data. In contrast to the conventional gene-centered view of NMF, identifying metagenes, we used NMF in a cell-centered direction, identifying cell subtypes ("metacells"). Using three different data sets (based on RT-qPCR and single cell RNA-seq data, respectively), we show that NMF outperforms PCA in identifying subpopulations in an accurate and robust way, without the need for prior feature selection; moreover, NMF successfully recovered the broad classes on a large data set (thousands of single-cell transcriptomes), as identified by a computationally sophisticated method. NMF allows to identify feature genes in a direct, unbiased manner. We propose novel approaches for determining a biologically meaningful number of subpopulations based on minimizing the ambiguity of classification. In conclusion, our study shows that NMF is a robust, informative and simple method for the unsupervised learning of cell subtypes from single-cell gene expression data.

When applied to a set ofDrosophilaearly embryonic spatial gene expression images, one of the largest datasets of its kind, staNMF identified 21 principal patterns (PP). Providing a compact yet biologically interpretable representation ofDrosophilaexpression patterns, PP are comparable to a fate map generated experimentally by laser ablation and show exceptional promise as a data-driven alternative to manual annotations. Our analysis mapped genes to cell-fate programs and assigned putative biological roles to uncharacterized genes. Finally, we used the PP to generate local transcription factor regulatory networks. Spatially local correlation networks were constructed for six PP that span along the embryonic anterior-posterior axis. Using a two-tail 5{\%} cutoff on correlation, we reproduced 10 of the 11 links in the well-studied gap gene network. The performance of PP with theDrosophiladata suggests that staNMF provides informative decompositions and constitutes a useful computational lens through which to extract biological insight from complex and often noisy gene expression data.},

abstract = { Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) and eQTL analyses have produced a large and growing number of genetic associations linked to a wide range of human phenotypes. As of 2013, there were more than 11,000 SNPs associated with a trait as reported in the NHGRI GWAS Catalog. However, interpreting the functional roles played by these SNPs remains a challenge. Here we describe an approach that uses the inherent bipartite structure of eQTL networks to place SNPs into a functional context.

Using genotyping and gene expression data from 163 lung tissue samples in a study of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) we calculated eQTL associations between SNPs and genes and cast significant associations (FDR {\textless}0.1) as links in a bipartite network. To our surprise, we discovered that the highly-connected "hub" SNPs within the network were devoid of disease-associations. However, within the network we identified 35 highly modular communities, which comprise groups of SNPs associated with groups of genes; 13 of these communities were significantly enriched for distinct biological functions (P {\textless}5×10−4) including COPD-related functions. Further, we found that GWAS-significant SNPs were enriched at the cores of these communities, including previously identified GWAS associations for COPD, asthma, and pulmonary function, among others. These results speak to our intuition: rather than single SNPs influencing single genes, we see groups of SNPs associated with the expression of families of functionally related genes and that disease SNPs are associated with the perturbation of those functions. These methods are not limited in their application to COPD and can be used in the analysis of a wide variety of disease processes and other phenotypic traits. },

abstract = {Cancer genomes contain vast amounts of somatic mutations, many of which are passenger mutations not involved in oncogenesis. Whereas driver mutations in protein-coding genes can be distinguished from passenger mutations based on their recurrence, non-coding mutations are usually not recurrent at the same position. Therefore, it is still unclear how to identify cis-regulatory driver mutations, particularly when chromatin data from the same patient is not available, thus relying only on sequence and expression information. Here we use machine-learning methods to predict functional regulatory regions using sequence information alone, and compare the predicted activity of the mutated region with the reference sequence. This way we define the Predicted Regulatory Impact of a Mutation in an Enhancer (PRIME). We find that the recently identified driver mutation in the TAL1 enhancer has a high PRIME score, representing a "gain-of-target" for MYB, whereas the highly recurrent TERT promoter mutation has a surprisingly low PRIME score. We trained Random Forest models for 45 cancer-related transcription factors, and used these to score variations in the HeLa genome and somatic mutations across more than five hundred cancer genomes. Each model predicts only a small fraction of non-coding mutations with a potential impact on the function of the encompassing regulatory region. Nevertheless, as these few candidate driver mutations are often linked to gains in chromatin activity and gene expression, they may contribute to the oncogenic program by altering the expression levels of specific oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes.},

Computational methods have been developed to predict the genomic locations of active enhancers based on histone modifications, but the accuracy and resolution of these methods remain limited.

Compared with existing methods, REPTILE shows consistently superior performance across diverse cell and tissue types, and the enhancer locations are significantly more refined.

abstract = {Circadian rhythms modulate many aspects of physiology. Knowledge of the molecular basis of these rhythms has exploded in the last 20 years. However, most of these data are from model organisms, and translation to clinical practice has been limited. Here, we present an approach to identify molecular rhythms in humans from thousands of unordered expression measurements. Our algorithm, cyclic ordering by periodic structure (CYCLOPS), uses evolutionary conservation and machine learning to identify elliptical structure in high-dimensional data. From this structure, CYCLOPS estimates the phase of each sample. We validated CYCLOPS using temporally ordered mouse and human data and demonstrated its consistency on human data from two independent research sites. We used this approach to identify rhythmic transcripts in human liver and lung, including hundreds of drug targets and disease genes. Importantly, for many genes, the circadian variation in expression exceeded variation from genetic and other environmental factors. We also analyzed hepatocellular carcinoma samples and show these solid tumors maintain circadian function but with aberrant output. Finally, to show how this method can catalyze medical translation, we show that dosage time can temporally segregate efficacy from dose-limiting toxicity of streptozocin, a chemotherapeutic drug. In sum, these data show the power of CYCLOPS and temporal reconstruction in bridging basic circadian research and clinical medicine.},

abstract = {Living organisms are very sensitive to temperature, and much of this is attributed to its effect on the structure and function of proteins. Leuenberger et al. explored thermostability on a proteome-wide scale in bacteria, yeast, and human cells by using a combination of limited proteolysis and mass spectrometry (see the Perspective by Vogel). Their results suggest that temperature-induced cell death is caused by the loss of a subset of proteins with key functions. The study also provides insight into the molecular and evolutionary bases of protein and proteome stability.Science, this issue p. eaai7825; see also p. 794INTRODUCTIONTemperature is crucially important to life. Small temperature changes can differentiate optimal and lethal growth conditions of living organisms. Because of the higher abundance and lower stability of proteins as compared with those of other biological macromolecules, thermally induced cell death is thought to be due to protein denaturation, but the determinants of thermal sensitivity of proteomes remain largely uncharacterized.RATIONALETo determine the thermal stability of proteins on a proteome-wide scale and with domain-level resolution, we developed a structural proteomic approach that relies on limited proteolysis (LiP) and mass spectrometry (MS) applied over a range of temperatures.RESULTSOur LiP-MS strategy was validated through analysis of purified proteins in the presence and absence of a biologically relevant matrix. We then obtained proteome-wide thermal denaturation profiles for Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Thermus thermophilus, and human cells. In contrast to previous predications that proteome instability derives from the simultaneous and generalized loss of hundreds of proteins, we observed that at a temperature at which cells experience temperature-induced physiological impairment, a subset of essential proteins undergoes denaturation.Confirming results of previous studies on the basis of comparison of genomes of thermophilic and mesophilic bacteria, we observed enrichment for lysine residues and $\beta$-sheet structures in thermostable proteins. We also found that unstable proteins have a higher content of aspartic acid than that of stable proteins and observed an inverse correlation between protein length and thermal stability. Further, thermostable proteins are substantially less prone to thermal aggregation than unstable proteins.Relative domain thermostability was conserved both within species and across organisms. Thermal stability was not generally similar for proteins encoded by orthologous genes. This suggests that the melting temperatures of proteins are affected by the reshuffling of protein domains, despite the conservation of domain stability.According to the {\{}$\backslash$textquotedblleft{\}}translational robustness{\{}$\backslash$textquotedblright{\}} theory, highly expressed proteins must tolerate translational errors that can lead to the accumulation of toxic misfolded species. Our data show a clear direct relationship between protein thermal stability and intracellular abundance and an inverse relationship between protein stability and aggregation or local unfolding. Increasing the thermodynamic stabilities of the folds of abundant proteins will broaden the range of amino acid replacements that a protein can tolerate before misfolding. Our findings suggest that over the course of evolution, the burden of intracellular misfolding has been reduced by increasing the thermodynamic stability of abundant proteins. Last, although up to 30{\%} of proteomes have been predicted to consist of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), our data revealed that about half of these proteins showed two-state denaturation profiles in the cellular matrix. This suggests that many IDPs are globally or locally structured in cells.CONCLUSIONOur study contributes insight into the molecular and evolutionary bases of protein and proteome thermostability and provides a blueprint for future studies on the stability of proteomes and thermal denaturation.Protein-protein interaction network of E. coli.Node color indicates protein thermostability. Blue, unstable; yellow, medium-stable; orange, stable; gray, not measured. At the temperature of thermal cell death of E. coli, a subset of highly connected protein nodes involved in key cellular processes undergoes temperature-induced denaturation.Temperature-induced cell death is thought to be due to protein denaturation, but the determinants of thermal sensitivity of proteomes remain largely uncharacterized. We developed a structural proteomic strategy to measure protein thermostability on a proteome-wide scale and with domain-level resolution. We applied it to Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Thermus thermophilus, and human cells, yielding thermostability data for more than 8000 proteins. Our results (i) indicate that temperature-induced cellular collapse is due to the loss of a subset of proteins with key functions, (ii) shed light on the evolutionary conservation of protein and domain stability, and (iii) suggest that natively disordered proteins in a cell are less prevalent than predicted and (iv) that highly expressed proteins are stable because they are designed to tolerate translational errors that would lead to the accumulation of toxic misfolded species.},

abstract = {Motivation: Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) is the standard method to investigate chromatin protein composition. As the number of community-available ChIP-seq profiles increases, it becomes more common to use data from different sources, which makes joint analysis challenging. Issues such as lack of reproducibility, heterogeneous quality and conflicts between replicates become evident when comparing datasets, especially when they are produced by different laboratories.

Results: Here, we present Zerone, a ChIP-seq discretizer with built-in quality control. Zerone is powered by a Hidden Markov Model with zero-inflated negative multinomial emissions, which allows it to merge several replicates into a single discretized profile. To identify low quality or irreproducible data, we trained a Support Vector Machine and integrated it as part of the discretization process. The result is a classifier reaching 95{\%} accuracy in detecting low quality profiles. We also introduce a graphical representation to compare discretization quality and we show that Zerone achieves outstanding accuracy. Finally, on current hardware, Zerone discretizes a ChIP-seq experiment on mammalian genomes in about 5{\^{a}}€‚min using less than 700{\^{a}}€‚MB of memory.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Identifying the shared and pathogen-specific components of host transcriptional regulatory programs is important for understanding the principles of regulation of immune response. Recent efforts in systems biology studies of infectious diseases have resulted in a large collection of datasets measuring host transcriptional response to various pathogens. Computational methods to identify and compare gene expression modules across different infections offer a powerful way to identify strain-specific and shared components of the regulatory program. An important challenge is to identify statistically robust gene expression modules as well as to reliably detect genes that change their module memberships between infections. RESULTS: We present MULCCH (MULti-task spectral Consensus Clustering for Hierarchically related tasks), a consensus extension of a multi-task clustering algorithm to infer high-confidence strain-specific host response modules under infections from multiple virus strains. On simulated data, MULCCH more accurately identifies genes exhibiting pathogen-specific patterns compared to non-consensus and nonmulti-task clustering approaches. Application of MULCCH to mammalian transcriptional response to a panel of influenza viruses showed that our method identifies clusters with greater coherence compared to non-consensus methods. Further, MULCCH derived clusters are enriched for several immune system-related processes and regulators. In summary, MULCCH provides a reliable module-based approach to identify molecular pathways and gene sets characterizing commonality and specificity of host response to viruses of different pathogenicities.

The development of fast algorithms is paramount to allow large-scale simulations. The Gillespie algorithm can be used for fast simulation of stochastic processes, and variants of it have been applied to simulate dynamical processes on static networks. However, its adaptation to temporal networks remains non-trivial. We here present a temporal Gillespie algorithm that solves this problem. Our method is applicable to general Poisson (constant-rate) processes on temporal networks, stochastically exact, and up to multiple orders of magnitude faster than traditional simulation schemes based on rejection sampling. We also show how it can be extended to simulate non-Markovian processes. The algorithm is easily applicable in practice, and as an illustration we detail how to simulate both Poissonian and non-Markovian models of epidemic spreading. Namely, we provide pseudocode and its implementation in C++ for simulating the paradigmatic Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible and Susceptible-Infected-Recovered models and a Susceptible-Infected-Recovered model with non-constant recovery rates. For empirical networks, the temporal Gillespie algorithm is here typically from 10 to 100 times faster than rejection sampling.},

Numerous methods have been developed to identify driver genes, but evaluation of the performance of these methods is hindered by the lack of a gold standard, that is, bona fide driver gene mutations. Here, we establish an evaluation framework that can be applied to driver gene prediction methods. We used this framework to compare the performance of eight such methods. One of these methods, described here, incorporated a machine-learning-based ratiometric approach. We show that the driver genes predicted by each of the eight methods vary widely. Moreover, the P values reported by several of the methods were inconsistent with the uniform values expected, thus calling into question the assumptions that were used to generate them. Finally, we evaluated the potential effects of unexplained variability in mutation rates on false-positive driver gene predictions.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:RNA-Seq has emerged as the standard for measuring gene expression and is an important technique often used in studies of human disease. Gene expression quantification involves comparison of the sequenced reads to a known genomic or transcriptomic reference. The accuracy of that quantification relies on there being enough unique information in the reads to enable bioinformatics tools to accurately assign the reads to the correct gene.RESULTS:We apply 12 common methods to estimate gene expression from RNA-Seq data and show that there are hundreds of genes whose expression is underestimated by one or more of those methods. Many of these genes have been implicated in human disease, and we describe their roles. We go on to propose a two-stage analysis of RNA-Seq data in which multi-mapped or ambiguous reads can instead be uniquely assigned to groups of genes. We apply this method to a recently published mouse cancer study, and demonstrate that we can extract relevant biological signal from data that would otherwise have been discarded.CONCLUSIONS:For hundreds of genes in the human genome, RNA-Seq is unable to measure expression accurately. These genes are enriched for gene families, and many of them have been implicated in human disease. We show that it is possible to use data that may otherwise have been discarded to measure group-level expression, and that such data contains biologically relevant information.},

Here, we show that codon usage strongly correlates with both protein and mRNA levels genome-wide in the filamentous fungus Neurospora Gene codon optimization also results in strong up-regulation of protein and RNA levels, suggesting that codon usage is an important determinant of gene expression. Surprisingly, we found that the impact of codon usage on gene expression results mainly from effects on transcription and is largely independent of mRNA translation and mRNA stability. Furthermore, we show that histone H3 lysine 9 trimethylation is one of the mechanisms responsible for the codon usage-mediated transcriptional silencing of some genes with nonoptimal codons. Together, these results uncovered an unexpected important role of codon usage in ORF sequences in determining transcription levels and suggest that codon biases are an adaptation of protein coding sequences to both transcription and translation machineries. Therefore, synonymous codons not only specify protein sequences and translation dynamics, but also help determine gene expression levels.},

abstract = {Quantitatively identifying direct dependencies between variables is an important task in data analysis, in particular for reconstructing various types of networks and causal relations in science and engineering. One of the most widely used criteria is partial correlation, but it can only measure linearly direct association and miss nonlinear associations. However, based on conditional independence, conditional mutual information (CMI) is able to quantify nonlinearly direct relationships among variables from the observed data, superior to linear measures, but suffers from a serious problem of underestimation, in particular for those variables with tight associations in a network, which severely limits its applications. In this work, we propose a new concept, "partial independence," with a new measure, "part mutual information" (PMI), which not only can overcome the problem of CMI but also retains the quantification properties of both mutual information (MI) and CMI. Specifically, we first defined PMI to measure nonlinearly direct dependencies between variables and then derived its relations with MI and CMI. Finally, we used a number of simulated data as benchmark examples to numerically demonstrate PMI features and further real gene expression data from Escherichia coli and yeast to reconstruct gene regulatory networks, which all validated the advantages of PMI for accurately quantifying nonlinearly direct associations in networks.},

abstract = {Recent advances in molecular biology allow the quantification of the transcriptome and scoring transcripts as differentially or equally expressed between two biological conditions. Although these two tasks are closely linked, the available inference methods treat them separately: a primary model is used to estimate expression and its output is post processed by using a differential expression model. In the paper, both issues are simultaneously addressed by proposing the joint estimation of expression levels and differential expression: the unknown relative abundance of each transcript can either be equal or not between two conditions. A hierarchical Bayesian model builds on the BitSeq framework and the posterior distribution of transcript expression and differential expression is inferred by using Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. It is shown that the model proposed enjoys conjugacy for fixed dimension variables; thus the full conditional distributions are analytically derived. Two samplers are constructed, a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo sampler and a collapsed Gibbs sampler, and the latter is found to perform better. A cluster representation of the aligned reads to the transcriptome is introduced, allowing parallel estimation of the marginal posterior distribution of subsets of transcripts under reasonable computing time. Under a fixed prior probability of differential expression the clusterwise sampler has the same marginal posterior distributions as the raw sampler, but a more general prior structure is also employed. The algorithm proposed is benchmarked against alternative methods by using synthetic data sets and applied to real RNA sequencing data.

Relying on a novel highly sensitive data analysis method we show that a significant rate of ribosome drop-off is measurable and can be quantified also when cells are cultured under non-stressing conditions. Moreover, we find that the drop-off rate is highly variable, depending on multiple factors. In particular, under environmental stress such as amino acid starvation or ethanol intoxication, the drop-off rate markedly increases.},

Many standard modeling and data analysis methods use underlying assumptions (e.g. concerning the rate at which new cases of disease will occur) which are rarely challenged or tested in practice. To relax these assumptions, we develop a Bayesian non-parametric approach using Gaussian Processes, specifically to estimate the infection process. The methods are illustrated with both simulated and real data sets, the former illustrating that the methods can recover the true infection process quite well in practice, and the latter illustrating that the methods can be successfully applied in different settings. },

Previous studies have analysed specific genes, often using their function as a proxy for fitness, experimentally assessing the effect on function of single mutations and their combinations in a specific sequence or in different sequences. However, systematic high-throughput studies of the local fitness landscape of an entire protein have not yet been reported. Here we visualize an extensive region of the local fitness landscape of the green fluorescent protein from Aequorea victoria (avGFP) by measuring the native function (fluorescence) of tens of thousands of derivative genotypes of avGFP. We show that the fitness landscape of avGFP is narrow, with 3/4 of the derivatives with a single mutation showing reduced fluorescence and half of the derivatives with four mutations being completely non-fluorescent. The narrowness is enhanced by epistasis, which was detected in up to 30{\%} of genotypes with multiple mutations and mostly occurred through the cumulative effect of slightly deleterious mutations causing a threshold-like decrease in protein stability and a concomitant loss of fluorescence. A model of orthologous sequence divergence spanning hundreds of millions of years predicted the extent of epistasis in our data, indicating congruence between the fitness landscape properties at the local and global scales. The characterization of the local fitness landscape of avGFP has important implications for several fields including molecular evolution, population genetics and protein design.},

abstract = {In mammals, DNA methylation occurs mainly at CpG dinucleotides. Methylation of the promoter suppresses gene expression, but the functional role of gene-body DNA methylation in highly expressed genes has yet to be clarified. Here we show that, in mouse embryonic stem cells, Dnmt3b-dependent intragenic DNA methylation protects the gene body from spurious RNA polymerase II entry and cryptic transcription initiation. Using different genome-wide approaches, we demonstrate that this Dnmt3b function is dependent on its enzymatic activity and recruitment to the gene body by H3K36me3. Furthermore, the spurious transcripts can either be degraded by the RNA exosome complex or capped, polyadenylated, and delivered to the ribosome to produce aberrant proteins. Elongating RNA polymerase II therefore triggers an epigenetic crosstalk mechanism that involves SetD2, H3K36me3, Dnmt3b and DNA methylation to ensure the fidelity of gene transcription initiation, with implications for intragenic hypomethylation in cancer.},

abstract = {Natural regulatory RNAs like riboswitches and RNA thermometers (RNAT) have considerable potential in synthetic biology. They are located in the 5′ untranslated region (UTR) of bacterial mRNAs and sense small molecules or changes in temperature, respectively. While riboswitches act on the level of transcription, translation or mRNA stability, all currently known RNATs regulate translation initiation. In this study, we explored the modularity of riboswitches and RNATs and obtained regulatory devices with novel functionalities. In a first approach, we established three riboswitch-RNAT systems conferring dual regulation of transcription and translation depending on the two triggers ligand binding and temperature sensing. These consecutive fusions control gene expression in vivo and can even orchestrate complex cellular behavior. In another approach, we designed two temperature-controlled riboswitches by the integration of an RNAT into a riboswitch aptamer domain. These ‘thermoswitches' respond to the cognate ligand at low temperatures and are turned into a continuous on-state by a temperature upshift. They represent the first RNATs taking control of transcription. Overall, this study demonstrates that riboswitches and RNATs are ideal for engineering synthetic RNA regulators due to their modular behavior.},

abstract = {In vertebrates, methylation of cytosine at CpG sequences is implicated in stable and heritable patterns of gene expression. The classical model for inheritance, in which individual CpG sites are independent, provides no explanation for the observed non-random patterns of methylation. We first investigate the exact topology of CpG clustering in the human genome associated to CpG islands. Then, by pooling genomic CpG clusters on the basis of short distances between CpGs within and long distances outside clusters, we show a strong dependence of methylation on the number and density of CpG organization. CpG clusters with fewer, or less densely spaced, CpGs are predominantly hyper-methylated, while larger clusters are predominantly hypo-methylated. Intermediate clusters, however, are either hyper- or hypo-methylated but are rarely found in intermediate methylation states. We develop a model for spatially-dependent collaboration between CpGs, where methylated CpGs recruit methylation enzymes that can act on CpGs over an extended local region, while unmethylated CpGs recruit demethylation enzymes that act more strongly on nearby CpGs. This model can reproduce the effects of CpG clustering on methylation and produces stable and heritable alternative methylation states of CpG clusters, thus providing a coherent model for methylation inheritance and methylation patterning.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The initial next-generation sequencing technologies produced reads of 25 or 36 bp, and only from a single-end of the library sequence. Currently, it is possible to reliably produce 300 bp paired-end sequences for RNA expression analysis. While read lengths have consistently increased, people have assumed that longer reads are more informative and that paired-end reads produce better results than single-end reads. We used paired-end 101 bp reads and trimmed them to simulate different read lengths, and also separated the pairs to produce single-end reads. For each read length and paired status, we evaluated differential expression levels between two standard samples and compared the results to those obtained by qPCR.RESULTS:We found that, with the exception of 25 bp reads, there is little difference for the detection of differential expression regardless of the read length. Once single-end reads are at a length of 50 bp, the results do not change substantially for any level up to, and including, 100 bp paired-end. However, splice junction detection significantly improves as the read length increases with 100 bp paired-end showing the best performance. We performed the same analysis on two ENCODE samples and found consistent results confirming that our conclusions have broad application.CONCLUSIONS:A researcher could save substantial resources by using 50 bp single-end reads for differential expression analysis instead of using longer reads. However, splicing detection is unquestionably improved by paired-end and longer reads. Therefore, an appropriate read length should be used based on the final goal of the study.},

Here, we investigate the ATP-induced calcium dynamics of monolayers of fibroblast cells that communicate via gap junctions. Combining experiments and stochastic modeling, we find that increasing the ATP stimulus increases the propensity for calcium oscillations, despite large cell-to-cell variability. The model further predicts that the oscillation propensity increases with not only the stimulus, but also the cell density due to increased communication. Experiments confirm this prediction, showing that cell density modulates the collective sensory response. We further implicate cell-cell communication by coculturing the fibroblasts with cancer cells, which we show act as "defects" in the communication network, thereby reducing the oscillation propensity. These results suggest that multicellular networks sit at a point in parameter space where cell-cell communication has a significant effect on the sensory response, allowing cells to simultaneously respond to a sensory input and the presence of neighbors.},

abstract = {Mechanistic mathematical modeling of biochemical reaction networks using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models has improved our understanding of small- and medium-scale biological processes. While the same should in principle hold for large- and genome-scale processes, the computational methods for the analysis of ODE models which describe hundreds or thousands of biochemical species and reactions are missing so far. While individual simulations are feasible, the inference of the model parameters from experimental data is computationally too intensive. In this manuscript, we evaluate adjoint sensitivity analysis for parameter estimation in large scale biochemical reaction networks. We present the approach for time-discrete measurement and compare it to state-of-the-art methods used in systems and computational biology. Our comparison reveals a significantly improved computational efficiency and a superior scalability of adjoint sensitivity analysis. The computational complexity is effectively independent of the number of parameters, enabling the analysis of large- and genome-scale models. Our study of a comprehensive kinetic model of ErbB signaling shows that parameter estimation using adjoint sensitivity analysis requires a fraction of the computation time of established methods. The proposed method will facilitate mechanistic modeling of genome-scale cellular processes, as required in the age of omics.},

Recent studies have shown that a splicing-associated RNA production delay can be significant. To investigate this issue more generally, it is useful to develop methods applicable to genome-wide datasets. We introduce a joint model of transcriptional activation and mRNA accumulation that can be used for inference of transcription rate, RNA production delay, and degradation rate given data from high-throughput sequencing time course experiments. We combine a mechanistic differential equation model with a nonparametric statistical modeling approach allowing us to capture a broad range of activation kinetics, and we use Bayesian parameter estimation to quantify the uncertainty in estimates of the kinetic parameters. We apply the model to data from estrogen receptor alpha activation in the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. We use RNA polymerase II ChIP-Seq time course data to characterize transcriptional activation and mRNA-Seq time course data to quantify mature transcripts. We find that 11{\%} of genes with a good signal in the data display a delay of more than 20 min between completing transcription and mature mRNA production. The genes displaying these long delays are significantly more likely to be short. We also find a statistical association between high delay and late intron retention in pre-mRNA data, indicating significant splicing-associated production delays in many genes.},

Here, we propose an alternative deterministic methodology that relies on sparse polynomial approximations. We propose a deterministic computational interpolation scheme which identifies most significant expansion coefficients adaptively. We present its performance in kinetic model equations from computational systems biology with several hundred parameters and state variables, leading to numerical approximations of the parametric solution on the entire parameter space. The scheme is based on adaptive Smolyak interpolation of the parametric solution at judiciously and adaptively chosen points in parameter space. As Monte-Carlo sampling, it is "non-intrusive" and well-suited for massively parallel implementation, but affords higher convergence rates.

We identify a sequence $\psi$* that is optimal in the sense that the $\psi$*-auxiliary particle filter's estimate of L has zero variance. In practical applications, $\psi$* is unknown so the $\psi$*-auxiliary particle filter cannot straightforwardly be implemented. We use an iterative scheme to approximate $\psi$*, and demonstrate empirically that the resulting iterated auxiliary particle filter significantly outperforms the bootstrap particle filter in challenging settings.

We found that, after randomization, PSM cells self-organized into several miniature emergent PSM structures (ePSM). Our results show an ordered macroscopic spatial arrangement of ePSM with evidence of an intrinsic length scale. Furthermore, cells actively synchronize oscillations in a Notch-signaling-dependent manner, re-establishing wave-like patterns of gene activity. We demonstrate that PSM cells self-organize by tuning oscillation dynamics in response to surrounding cells, leading to collective synchronization with an average frequency.

We apply the joint modeling approach for inferring base pairing states on simulated data sets and RNase-seq profiles of the double-strand specific RNase V1 and single-strand specific RNase S1 in yeast. We demonstrate that joint analysis of V1 and S1 profiles outputs interpretable RNA structure states, while approaches that analyze each profile separately do not. The joint modeling approach predicts the structure states of all nucleotides in 3196 transcripts of yeast without compromising accuracy, while the simple thresholding approach misses 43{\%} of the nucleotides. Furthermore, the posterior probabilities outputted by our model are able to resolve the structural ambiguity of {\^{a}}‰ˆ300 000 nucleotides with overlapping V1 and S1 cleavage sites. Our model also generates RNA accessibilities, which are associated with three-dimensional conformations.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Metagenomics characterizes the taxonomic diversity of microbial communities by sequencing DNA directly from an environmental sample. One of the main challenges in metagenomics data analysis is the binning step, where each sequenced read is assigned to a taxonomic clade. Due to the large volume of metagenomics datasets, binning methods need fast and accurate algorithms that can operate with reasonable computing requirements. While standard alignment-based methods provide state-of-the-art performance, compositional approaches that assign a taxonomic class to a DNA read based on the k-mers it contains have the potential to provide faster solutions. RESULTS: We propose a new rank-flexible machine learning-based compositional approach for taxonomic assignment of metagenomics reads and show that it benefits from increasing the number of fragments sampled from reference genome to tune its parameters, up to a coverage of about 10, and from increasing the k-mer size to about 12. Tuning the method involves training machine learning models on about 108 samples in 107 dimensions, which is out of reach of standard softwares but can be done efficiently with modern implementations for large-scale machine learning. The resulting method is competitive in terms of accuracy with well-established alignment and composition-based tools for problems involving a small to moderate number of candidate species, and for reasonable amounts of sequencing errors. We show, however, that machine learning-based compositional approaches are still limited in their ability to deal with problems involving a greater number of species, and more sensitive to sequencing errors. We finally show that the new method outperforms the state-of-the-art in its ability to classify reads from species of lineage absent from the reference database and confirm that compositional approaches achieve faster prediction times, with a gain of 2 to 17 times with respect to the BWA-MEM short read mapper, depending on the number of candidate species and the level of sequencing noise.

abstract = {A key quantity of interest in Bayesian inference are expectations of functions with respect to a posterior distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo is a fundamental tool to consistently compute these expectations via averaging samples drawn from an approximate posterior. However, its feasibility is being challenged in the era of so called Big Data as all data needs to be processed in every iteration. Realising that such simulation is an unnecessarily hard problem if the goal is estimation, we construct a computationally scalable methodology that allows unbiased estimation of the required expectations -- without explicit simulation from the full posterior. The scheme's variance is finite by construction and straightforward to control, leading to algorithms that are provably unbiased and naturally arrive at a desired error tolerance. This is achieved at an average computational complexity that is sub-linear in the size of the dataset and its free parameters are easy to tune. We demonstrate the utility and generality of the methodology on a range of common statistical models applied to large-scale benchmark and real-world datasets.},

abstract = {N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is a prevalent RNA methylation modification involved in the regulation of degradation, subcellular localization, splicing and local conformation changes of RNA transcripts. High-throughput experiments have demonstrated that only a small fraction of the m6A consensus motifs in mammalian transcriptomes are modified. Therefore, accurate identification of RNA m6A sites becomes emergently important. For the above purpose, here a computational predictor of mammalian m6A site named SRAMP is established. To depict the sequence context around m6A sites, SRAMP combines three random forest classifiers that exploit the positional nucleotide sequence pattern, the K-nearest neighbor information and the position-independent nucleotide pair spectrum features, respectively. SRAMP uses either genomic sequences or cDNA sequences as its input. With either kind of input sequence, SRAMP achieves competitive performance in both cross-validation tests and rigorous independent benchmarking tests. Analyses of the informative features and overrepresented rules extracted from the random forest classifiers demonstrate that nucleotide usage preferences at the distal positions, in addition to those at the proximal positions, contribute to the classification.

abstract = {Methyl-CpG binding protein 2 (MeCP2) has crucial roles in transcriptional regulation and microRNA processing. Mutations in the MECP2 gene are found in 90{\%} of patients with Rett syndrome, a severe developmental disorder with autistic phenotypes. Duplications of MECP2-containing genomic segments cause the MECP2 duplication syndrome, which shares core symptoms with autism spectrum disorders. Although Mecp2-null mice recapitulate most developmental and behavioural defects seen in patients with Rett syndrome, it has been difficult to identify autism-like behaviours in the mouse model of MeCP2 overexpression. Here we report that lentivirus-based transgenic cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) expressing human MeCP2 in the brain exhibit autism-like behaviours and show germline transmission of the transgene. Expression of the MECP2 transgene was confirmed by western blotting and immunostaining of brain tissues of transgenic monkeys. Genomic integration sites of the transgenes were characterized by a deep-sequencing-based method. As compared to wild-type monkeys, MECP2 transgenic monkeys exhibited a higher frequency of repetitive circular locomotion and increased stress responses, as measured by the threat-related anxiety and defensive test. The transgenic monkeys showed less interaction with wild-type monkeys within the same group, and also a reduced interaction time when paired with other transgenic monkeys in social interaction tests. The cognitive functions of the transgenic monkeys were largely normal in the Wisconsin general test apparatus, although some showed signs of stereotypic cognitive behaviours. Notably, we succeeded in generating five F1 offspring of MECP2 transgenic monkeys by intracytoplasmic sperm injection with sperm from one F0 transgenic monkey, showing germline transmission and Mendelian segregation of several MECP2 transgenes in the F1 progeny. Moreover, F1 transgenic monkeys also showed reduced social interactions when tested in pairs, as compared to wild-type monkeys of similar age. Together, these results indicate the feasibility and reliability of using genetically engineered non-human primates to study brain disorders.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: The human microbial communities are associated with many human diseases such as obesity, diabetes and inflammatory bowel disease. High-throughput sequencing technology has been widely used to quantify the microbial composition in order to understand its impacts on human health. Longitudinal measurements of microbial communities are commonly obtained in many microbiome studies. A key question in such microbiome studies is to identify the microbes that are associated with clinical outcomes or environmental factors. However, microbiome compositional data are highly skewed, bounded in [0,1), and often sparse with many zeros. In addition, the observations from repeated measures in longitudinal studies are correlated. A method that takes into account these features is needed for association analysis in longitudinal microbiome data.
RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a two-part zero-inflated Beta regression model with random effects (ZIBR) for testing the association between microbial abundance and clinical covariates for longitudinal microbiome data. The model includes a logistic regression component to model presence/absence of a microbe in the samples and a Beta regression component to model non-zero microbial abundance, where each component includes a random effect to account for the correlations among the repeated measurements on the same subject. Both simulation studies and the application to real microbiome data have shown that ZIBR model outperformed the previously used methods. The method provides a useful tool for identifying the relevant taxa based on longitudinal or repeated measures in microbiome research.

Recent studies have revealed that they play important roles in building complex organisms and have a critical impact on biological functions which could cause disease. Quite a few analytical methods have been developed to facilitate alternative 3′ SS and 5′ SS studies using RNA-seq data.

Results: We propose an empirical Bayes change-point model to identify alternative 3′ SS and 5′ SS. Compared with previous methods, our approach has several unique merits. First of all, our model does not rely on annotation information. Instead, it provides for the first time a systematic framework to integrate various information when available, in particular the useful junction read information, in order to obtain better performance. Secondly, we utilize an empirical Bayes model to efficiently pool information across genes to improve detection efficiency. Thirdly, we provide a flexible testing framework in which the user can choose to address different levels of questions, namely, whether alternative 3′ SS or 5′ SS happens, and/or where it happens. Simulation studies and real data application have demonstrated that our method is powerful and accurate.

It is therefore essential that inclusion levels of alternative exons be tightly regulated. However, how the precision of inclusion levels among individual cells is governed is poorly understood. Using single-cell gene expression, we show that the precision of inclusion levels of alternative exons is determined by the degree of evolutionary conservation at their flanking intronic regions. Moreover, the inclusion levels of alternative exons, as well as the expression levels of the transcripts harboring them, also contribute to this precision. We further show that alternative exons whose inclusion levels are considerably changed during stem cell differentiation are also subject to this regulation. Our results imply that alternative splicing is coordinately regulated to achieve accuracy in relative isoform abundances and that such accuracy may be important in determining cell fate.},

abstract = {Imperfect knowledge of the times at which 'snapshots' of a system are recorded degrades our ability to recover dynamical information, and can scramble the sequence of events. In X-ray free-electron lasers, for example, the uncertainty--the so-called timing jitter--between the arrival of an optical trigger ('pump') pulse and a probing X-ray pulse can exceed the length of the X-ray pulse by up to two orders of magnitude, marring the otherwise precise time-resolution capabilities of this class of instruments. The widespread notion that little dynamical information is available on timescales shorter than the timing uncertainty has led to various hardware schemes to reduce timing uncertainty. These schemes are expensive, tend to be specific to one experimental approach and cannot be used when the record was created under ill-defined or uncontrolled conditions such as during geological events. Here we present a data-analytical approach, based on singular-value decomposition and nonlinear Laplacian spectral analysis, that can recover the history and dynamics of a system from a dense collection of noisy snapshots spanning a sufficiently large multiple of the timing uncertainty. The power of the algorithm is demonstrated by extracting the underlying dynamics on the few-femtosecond timescale from noisy experimental X-ray free-electron laser data recorded with 300-femtosecond timing uncertainty. Using a noisy dataset from a pump-probe experiment on the Coulomb explosion of nitrogen molecules, our analysis reveals vibrational wave-packets consisting of components with periods as short as 15 femtoseconds, as well as more rapid changes, which have yet to be fully explored. Our approach can potentially be applied whenever dynamical or historical information is tainted by timing uncertainty.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of determining optimal designs for biological process models with intractable likelihoods, with the goal of parameter inference. The Bayesian approach is to choose a design that maximises the mean of a utility, and the utility is a function of the posterior distribution. Therefore, its estimation requires likelihood evaluations. However, many problems in experimental design involve models with intractable likelihoods, that is, likelihoods that are neither analytic nor can be computed in a reasonable amount of time. We propose a novel solution using indirect inference (II), a well established method in the literature, and the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm of M{\"{u}}ller et al. (2004). Indirect inference employs an auxiliary model with a tractable likelihood in conjunction with the generative model, the assumed true model of interest, which has an intractable likelihood. Our approach is to estimate a map between the parameters of the generative and auxiliary models, using simulations from the generative model. An II posterior distribution is formed to expedite utility estimation. We also present a modification to the utility that allows the M{\"{u}}ller algorithm to sample from a substantially sharpened utility surface, with little computational effort. Unlike competing methods, the II approach can handle complex design problems for models with intractable likelihoods on a continuous design space, with possible extension to many observations. The methodology is demonstrated using two stochastic models; a simple tractable death process used to validate the approach, and a motivating stochastic model for the population evolution of macroparasites.},

Both the folding and conformation of k-turns are determined by their local sequence. k-turns fall into two conformational classes, called N3 and N1, that differ in the pattern of hydrogen bonding in the core. We show here that this is determined by the basepair adjacent to the critical G•A pairs. We determined crystal structures of a series of Kt-7 variants in which this 3b,3n position has been systematically varied, showing that this leads to a switch in the conformation. We have previously shown that the 3b,3n position also determines the folding characteristics of the k-turn, i.e. whether or not the k-turn can fold in the presence of metal ions alone. We have analyzed the distribution of 3b,3n sequences from four classes of k-turns from ribosomes, riboswitches and U4 snRNA, finding a strong conservation of properties for a given k-turn type. We thus demonstrate a strong association between biological function, 3b,3n sequence and k-turn folding and conformation. This has strong predictive power, and can be applied to the modeling of large RNA architectures.},

In this work, we investigate the stability of the bird's neck during plunge-diving by understanding the interaction between the fluid forces acting on the head and the flexibility of the neck. First, we use a salvaged bird to identify plunge-diving phases. Anatomical features of the skull and neck were acquired to quantify the effect of beak geometry and neck musculature on the stability during a plunge-dive. Second, physical experiments using an elastic beam as a model for the neck attached to a skull-like cone revealed the limits for the stability of the neck during the bird's dive as a function of impact velocity and geometric factors. We find that the neck length, neck muscles, and diving speed of the bird predominantly reduce the likelihood of injury during the plunge-dive.

However, the underlying processes and consequences on fluctuations in gene products are poorly understood. Here, we use single allele time-lapse recordings in mouse cells to identify minimal models of promoter cycles, which inform on the number and durations of rate-limiting steps responsible for refractory periods. The structure of promoter cycles is gene specific and independent of genomic location. Typically, five rate-limiting steps underlie the silent periods of endogenous promoters, while minimal synthetic promoters exhibit only one. Strikingly, endogenous or synthetic promoters with TATA boxes show simplified two-state promoter cycles. Since transcriptional bursting constrains intrinsic noise depending on the number of promoter steps, this explains why TATA box genes display increased intrinsic noise genome-wide in mammals, as revealed by single-cell RNA-seq. These findings have implications for basic transcription biology and shed light on interpreting single-cell RNA-counting experiments.},

abstract = {During pre-mRNA splicing, a central step in the expression and regulation of eukaryotic genes, the spliceosome selects splice sites for intron excision and exon ligation. In doing so, the spliceosome must distinguish optimal from suboptimal splice sites. At the catalytic stage of splicing, suboptimal splice sites are repressed by the DEAH-box ATPases Prp16 and Prp22. Here, using budding yeast, we show that these ATPases function further by enabling the spliceosome to search for and utilize alternative branch sites and 3′ splice sites. The ATPases facilitate this search by remodeling the splicing substrate to disengage candidate splice sites. Our data support a mechanism involving 3′ to 5′ translocation of the ATPases along substrate RNA and toward a candidate site, but, surprisingly, not across the site. Thus, our data implicate DEAH-box ATPases in acting at a distance by pulling substrate RNA from the catalytic core of the spliceosome.},

abstract = {Landscapes exhibiting multiple secondary structures arise in natural RNA molecules that modulate gene expression, protein synthesis, and viral. We report herein that high-throughput chemical experiments can isolate an RNA's multiple alternative secondary structures as they are stabilized by systematic mutagenesis (mutate-and-map, M2) and that a computational algorithm, REEFFIT, enables unbiased reconstruction of these states' structures and populations. In an in silico benchmark on non-coding RNAs with complex landscapes, M2-REEFFIT recovers 95{\%} of RNA helices present with at least 25{\%} population while maintaining a low false discovery rate (10{\%}) and conservative error estimates. In experimental benchmarks, M2-REEFFIT recovers the structure landscapes of a 35-nt MedLoop hairpin, a 110-nt 16S rRNA four-way junction with an excited state, a 25-nt bistable hairpin, and a 112-nt three-state adenine riboswitch with its expression platform, molecules whose characterization previously required expert mutational analysis and specialized NMR or chemical mapping experiments. With this validation, M2-REEFFIT enabled tests of whether artificial RNA sequences might exhibit complex landscapes in the absence of explicit design. An artificial flavin mononucleotide riboswitch and a randomly generated RNA sequence are found to interconvert between three or more states, including structures for which there was no design, but that could be stabilized through mutations. These results highlight the likely pervasiveness of rich landscapes with multiple secondary structures in both natural and artificial RNAs and demonstrate an automated chemical/computational route for their empirical characterization.},

@article{doidy2016hit,
abstract = {Background
Dynamic transcriptional regulation is critical for an organism's response to environmental signals and yet remains elusive to capture. Such transcriptional regulation is mediated by master transcription factors (TF) that control large gene regulatory networks. Recently, we described a dynamic mode of TF regulation named “hit-and-run”. This model proposes that master TF can interact transiently with a set of targets, but the transcription of these transient targets continues after the TF dissociation from the target promoter. However, experimental evidence validating active transcription of the transient TF-targets is still lacking.

Results
Here, we show that active transcription continues after transient TF-target interactions by tracking de novo synthesis of RNAs made in response to TF nuclear import. To do this, we introduced an affinity-labeled 4-thiouracil (4tU) nucleobase to specifically isolate newly synthesized transcripts following conditional TF nuclear import. Thus, we extended the TARGET system (Transient Assay Reporting Genome-wide Effects of Transcription factors) to include 4tU-labeling and named this new technology TARGET-tU. Our proof-of-principle example is the master TF Basic Leucine Zipper 1 (bZIP1), a central integrator of metabolic signaling in plants. Using TARGET-tU, we captured newly synthesized mRNAs made in response to bZIP1 nuclear import at a time when bZIP1 is no longer detectably bound to its target. Thus, the analysis of de novo transcripomics demonstrates that bZIP1 may act as a catalyst TF to initiate a transcriptional complex (“hit”), after which active transcription by RNA polymerase continues without the TF being bound to the gene promoter (“run”).

Conclusion
Our findings provide experimental proof for active transcription of transient TF-targets supporting a “hit-and-run” mode of action. This dynamic regulatory model allows a master TF to catalytically propagate rapid and broad transcriptional responses to changes in environment. Thus, the functional read-out of de novo transcripts produced by transient TF-target interactions allowed us to capture new models for genome-wide transcriptional control.},

Although the chromosome conformation capture (3C) and its derivative methods have been developed for exploring the global interactome, they are limited by high experimental complexity and costs. Here we describe a novel computational method, called CITD, for de novo prediction of the chromatin interaction map by integrating histone modification data. We used the public epigenomic data from human fibroblast IMR90 cell and embryonic stem cell (H1) to develop and test CITD, which can not only successfully reconstruct the chromatin interaction frequencies discovered by the Hi-C technology, but also provide additional novel details of chromosomal organizations. We predicted the chromatin interaction frequencies, topological domains and their states (e.g. active or repressive) for 98 additional cell types from Roadmap Epigenomics and ENCODE projects. A total of 131 protein-coding genes located near 78 preserved boundaries among 100 cell types are found to be significantly enriched in functional categories of the nucleosome organization and chromatin assembly. CITD and its predicted results can be used for complementing the topological domains derived from limited Hi-C data and facilitating the understanding of spatial principles underlying the chromosomal organization.},

abstract = {Understanding the development and function of an organ requires the characterization of all of its cell types. Traditional methods for visualizing and isolating subpopulations of cells are based on messenger RNA or protein expression of only a few known marker genes. The unequivocal identification of a specific marker gene, however, poses a major challenge, particularly if this cell type is rare. Identifying rare cell types, such as stem cells, short-lived progenitors, cancer stem cells, or circulating tumour cells, is crucial to acquire a better understanding of normal or diseased tissue biology. To address this challenge we first sequenced the transcriptome of hundreds of randomly selected cells from mouse intestinal organoids, cultured self-organizing epithelial structures that contain all cell lineages of the mammalian intestine. Organoid buds, like intestinal crypts, harbour stem cells that continuously differentiate into a variety of cell types, occurring at widely different abundances. Since available computational methods can only resolve more abundant cell types, we developed RaceID, an algorithm for rare cell type identification in complex populations of single cells. We demonstrate that this algorithm can resolve cell types represented by only a single cell in a population of randomly sampled organoid cells. We use this algorithm to identify Reg4 as a novel marker for enteroendocrine cells, a rare population of hormone-producing intestinal cells. Next, we use Reg4 expression to enrich for these rare cells and investigate the heterogeneity within this population. RaceID confirmed the existence of known enteroendocrine lineages, and moreover discovered novel subtypes, which we subsequently validated in vivo. Having validated RaceID we then applied the algorithm to ex vivo-isolated Lgr5-positive stem cells and their direct progeny. We find that Lgr5-positive cells represent a homogenous abundant population of stem cells mixed with a rare population of Lgr5-positive secretory cells. We envision broad applicability of our method for discovering rare cell types and the corresponding marker genes in healthy and diseased organs.},

Whereas structural RNA alignment strategies typically identify common structure for orthologous structured RNAs, clustering seeks to group paralogous RNAs based on structural similarities. However, existing approaches for clustering paralogous RNAs, do not take the compensatory base pair changes obtained from structure conservation in orthologous sequences into account.
Results: Here, we present RNAscClust, the implementation of a new algorithm to cluster a set of structured RNAs taking their respective structural conservation into account. For a set of multiple structural alignments of RNA sequences, each containing a paralog sequence included in a structural alignment of its orthologs, RNAscClust computes minimum free-energy structures for each sequence using conserved base pairs as prior information for the folding. The paralogs are then clustered using a graph kernel-based strategy, which identifies common structural features.We show that the clustering accuracy clearly benefits from an increasing degree of compensatory base pair changes in the alignments.

The algorithm is based on a version of hybrid Monte Carlo simulation that delivers increased efficiency when used on the high-dimensional latent variables arising in this context.

To take full advantage of these two emerging datasets we need a framework that links them, revealing how collective neural activity arises from the structure of neural connectivity and intrinsic neural dynamics. This problem of structure-driven activity has drawn major interest in computational neuroscience. Existing methods for relating activity and architecture in spiking networks rely on linearizing activity around a central operating point and thus fail to capture the nonlinear responses of individual neurons that are the hallmark of neural information processing. Here, we overcome this limitation and present a new relationship between connectivity and activity in networks of nonlinear spiking neurons. We explicitly show how recurrent network structure produces pairwise and higher-order correlated activity, and how nonlinearities impact the networks' spiking activity. Finally, we demonstrate how correlations due to recurrent connectivity impact the fidelity with which populations encode simple signals and how nonlinear dynamics impose a new effect of correlations on coding: to translate response distributions in addition to stretching them. Our findings open new avenues to investigating how neural nonlinearities, including those expressed across multiple cell types, combine with connectivity to shape population activity and function.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: To better predict and analyze gene associations with the collection of phenotypes organized in a phenotype ontology, it is crucial to effectively model the hierarchical structure among the phenotypes in the ontology and leverage the sparse known associations with additional training information. In this paper, we first introduce Dual Label Propagation (DLP) to impose consistent associations with the entire phenotype paths in predicting phenotype-gene associations in Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO). DLP is then used as the base model in a transfer learning framework (tlDLP) to incorporate functional annotations in Gene Ontology (GO). By simultaneously reconstructing GO term-gene associations and HPO phenotype-gene associations for all the genes in a protein-protein interaction network, tlDLP benefits from the enriched training associations indirectly through relation with GO terms.
RESULTS: In the experiments to predict the associations between human genes and phenotypes in HPO based on human protein-protein interaction network, both DLP and tlDLP improved the prediction of gene associations with phenotype paths in HPO in cross-validation and the prediction of the most recent associations added after the snapshot of the training data. Moreover, the transfer learning through GO term-gene associations significantly improved association predictions for the phenotypes with no more specific known associations by a large margin. Examples are also shown to demonstrate how phenotype paths in phenotype ontology and transfer learning with gene ontology can improve the predictions.

Although most genetic diseases arise from point mutations, current approaches to point mutation correction are inefficient and typically induce an abundance of random insertions and deletions (indels) at the target locus resulting from the cellular response to dsDNA breaks. Here we report the development of 'base editing', a new approach to genome editing that enables the direct, irreversible conversion of one target DNA base into another in a programmable manner, without requiring dsDNA backbone cleavage or a donor template. We engineered fusions of CRISPR/Cas9 and a cytidine deaminase enzyme that retain the ability to be programmed with a guide RNA, do not induce dsDNA breaks, and mediate the direct conversion of cytidine to uridine, thereby effecting a C→T (or G→A) substitution. The resulting 'base editors' convert cytidines within a window of approximately five nucleotides, and can efficiently correct a variety of point mutations relevant to human disease. In four transformed human and murine cell lines, second- and third-generation base editors that fuse uracil glycosylase inhibitor, and that use a Cas9 nickase targeting the non-edited strand, manipulate the cellular DNA repair response to favour desired base-editing outcomes, resulting in permanent correction of {\~{}}15-75{\%} of total cellular DNA with minimal (typically ≤1{\%}) indel formation.

abstract = {In the noisy cellular environment, gene products are subject to inherent random fluctuations in copy numbers over time. How cells ensure precision in the timing of key intracellular events despite such stochasticity is an intriguing fundamental problem. We formulate event timing as a first-passage time problem, where an event is triggered when the level of a protein crosses a critical threshold for the first time. Analytical calculations are performed for the first-passage time distribution in stochastic models of gene expression. Derivation of these formulas motivates an interesting question: Is there an optimal feedback strategy to regulate the synthesis of a protein to ensure that an event will occur at a precise time, while minimizing deviations or noise about the mean? Counterintuitively, results show that for a stable long-lived protein, the optimal strategy is to express the protein at a constant rate without any feedback regulation, and any form of feedback (positive, negative, or any combination of them) will always amplify noise in event timing. In contrast, a positive feedback mechanism provides the highest precision in timing for an unstable protein. These theoretical results explain recent experimental observations of single-cell lysis times in bacteriophage [Formula: see text] Here, lysis of an infected bacterial cell is orchestrated by the expression and accumulation of a stable [Formula: see text] protein up to a threshold, and precision in timing is achieved via feedforward rather than feedback control. Our results have broad implications for diverse cellular processes that rely on precise temporal triggering of events.},

abstract = {Multi-regional sequencing provides new opportunities to investigate genetic heterogeneity within or between common tumors from an evolutionary perspective. Several state-of-the-art methods have been proposed for reconstructing cancer evolutionary trees based on multi-regional sequencing data to develop models of cancer evolution. However, there have been few studies on comparisons of a set of cancer evolutionary trees. We propose a clustering method (phyC) for cancer evolutionary trees, in which sub-groups of the trees are identified based on topology and edge length attributes. For interpretation, we also propose a method for evaluating the sub-clonal diversity of trees in the clusters, which provides insight into the acceleration of sub-clonal expansion. Simulation showed that the proposed method can detect true clusters with sufficient accuracy. Application of the method to actual multi-regional sequencing data of clear cell renal carcinoma and non-small cell lung cancer allowed for the detection of clusters related to cancer type or phenotype. phyC is implemented with R(≥3.2.2) and is available from https://github.com/ymatts/phyC.},

Here we revisit the first synthetic genetic oscillator, the repressilator, and modify it using principles from stochastic chemistry in single cells. Specifically, we sought to reduce error propagation and information losses, not by adding control loops, but by simply removing existing features. We show that this modification created highly regular and robust oscillations. Furthermore, some streamlined circuits kept 14 generation periods over a range of growth conditions and kept phase for hundreds of generations in single cells, allowing cells in flasks and colonies to oscillate synchronously without any coupling between them. Our results suggest that even the simplest synthetic genetic networks can achieve a precision that rivals natural systems, and emphasize the importance of noise analyses for circuit design in synthetic biology.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification with important roles in many biological processes and diseases. Bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) has emerged recently as the technology of choice to profile DNA methylation because of its accuracy, genome coverage, and higher resolution. Current statistical methods to identify differential methylation mainly focus on comparing two treatment groups. With an increasing number of experiments performed under a general and multiple-factor design, particularly in reduced representation bisulfite sequencing, there is a need to develop more flexible, powerful and computationally efficient methods. RESULTS: We present a novel statistical model to detect differentially methylated loci from BS-seq data under general experimental design, based on a beta-binomial regression model with "arcsine" link function. Parameter estimation is based on transformed data with generalized least square approach without relying on iterative algorithm. Simulation and real data analyses demonstrate that our method is accurate, powerful, robust and computationally efficient. AVAILABILITY: It is available as Bioconductor package DSS.

Predicting population growth characteristics based on knowledge of heterogeneous single-cell dynamics remains challenging. By observing groups of cells for hundreds of generations at single-cell resolution, we reveal that growth noise causes clonal populations ofEscherichia colito double faster than the mean doubling time of their constituent single cells across a broad set of balanced-growth conditions. We show that the population-level growth rate gain as well as age structures of populations and of cell lineages in competition are predictable. Furthermore, we theoretically reveal that the growth rate gain can be linked with the relative entropy of lineage generation time distributions. Unexpectedly, we find an empirical linear relation between the means and the variances of generation times across conditions, which provides a general constraint on maximal growth rates. Together, these results demonstrate a fundamental benefit of noise for population growth, and identify a growth law that sets a "speed limit" for proliferation.},

We show that an important challenge with Bayesian generalized linear modelling of continuous time Markov chains is that classical Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques are too ineffective to be practical in that setup. We address this issue using an auxiliary variable construction combined with an adaptive Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm. This sampling algorithm and model make it efficient both in terms of computation and analyst's time to construct stochastic processes informed by prior knowledge, such as known properties of the states of the process.

Here we report on a new mRNA modification, N(1)-methyladenosine (m(1)A), that occurs on thousands of different gene transcripts in eukaryotic cells, from yeast to mammals, at an estimated average transcript stoichiometry of 20{\%} in humans. Employing newly developed sequencing approaches, we show that m(1)A is enriched around the start codon upstream of the first splice site: it preferentially decorates more structured regions around canonical and alternative translation initiation sites, is dynamic in response to physiological conditions, and correlates positively with protein production. These unique features are highly conserved in mouse and human cells, strongly indicating a functional role for m(1)A in promoting translation of methylated mRNA.},

abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many peak detection algorithms have been proposed for ChIP-seq data analysis, but it is not obvious which algorithm and what parameters are optimal for any given data set. In contrast, regions with and without obvious peaks can be easily labeled by visual inspection of aligned read counts in a genome browser. We propose a supervised machine learning approach for ChIP-seq data analysis, using labels that encode qualitative judgments about which genomic regions contain or do not contain peaks. The main idea is to manually label a small subset of the genome, and then learn a model that makes consistent peak predictions on the rest of the genome.
RESULTS: We created 7 new histone mark data sets with 12,826 visually determined labels , and analyzed 3 existing transcription factor data sets. We observed that default peak detection parameters yield high false positive rates, which can be reduced by learning parameters using a relatively small training set of labeled data from the same experiment type. We also observed that labels from different people are highly consistent. Overall, these data indicate that our supervised labeling method is useful for quantitatively training and testing peak detection algorithms.

@article{Pavlovic:2017aa,
abstract = {Motivation: 5-Methylcytosine and 5-Hydroxymethylcytosine in DNA are major epigenetic modifications known to significantly alter mammalian gene expression. High-throughput assays to detect these modifications are expensive, labor-intensive, unfeasible in some contexts, and leave a portion of the genome unqueried. Hence, we devised a novel, supervised, integrative learning framework to perform whole-genome methylation and hydroxymethylation predictions in CpG dinucleotides. Our framework can also perform imputation of missing or low quality data in existing sequencing datasets. Additionally, we developed infrastructure to perform in silico , high-throughput hypotheses testing on such predicted methylation or hydroxymethylation maps.
Results: We test our approach on H1 human embryonic stem cells and H1-derived neural progenitor cells. Our predictive model is comparable in accuracy to other state-of-the-art DNA methylation prediction algorithms. We are the first to predict hydroxymethylation in silico with high whole-genome accuracy, paving the way for large-scale reconstruction of hydroxymethylation maps in mammalian model systems. We designed a novel, beam-search driven feature selection algorithm to identify the most discriminative predictor variables, and developed a platform for performing integrative analysis and reconstruction of the epigenome. Our toolkit DIRECTION provides predictions at single nucleotide resolution and identifies relevant features based on resource availability. This offers enhanced biological interpretability of results potentially leading to a better understanding of epigenetic gene regulation.

abstract = {Accuracy of transcript quantification with RNA-Seq is negatively affected by positional fragment bias. This article introduces Mix2 (rd. "mixquare"), a transcript quantification method which uses a mixture of probability distributions to model and thereby neutralize the effects of positional fragment bias. The parameters of Mix2 are trained by Expectation Maximization resulting in simultaneous transcript abundance and bias estimates. We compare Mix2 to Cufflinks, RSEM, eXpress and PennSeq; state-of-the-art quantification methods implementing some form of bias correction. On four synthetic biases we show that the accuracy of Mix2 overall exceeds the accuracy of the other methods and that its bias estimates converge to the correct solution. We further evaluate Mix2 on real RNA-Seq data from the Microarray and Sequencing Quality Control (MAQC, SEQC) Consortia. On MAQC data, Mix2 achieves improved correlation to qPCR measurements with a relative increase in R2 between 4{\%} and 50{\%}. Mix2 also yields repeatable concentration estimates across technical replicates with a relative increase in R2 between 8{\%} and 47{\%} and reduced standard deviation across the full concentration range. We further observe more accurate detection of differential expression with a relative increase in true positives between 74{\%} and 378{\%} for 5{\%} false positives. In addition, Mix2 reveals 5 dominant biases in MAQC data deviating from the common assumption of a uniform fragment distribution. On SEQC data, Mix2 yields higher consistency between measured and predicted concentration ratios. A relative error of 20{\%} or less is obtained for 51{\%} of transcripts by Mix2, 40{\%} of transcripts by Cufflinks and RSEM and 30{\%} by eXpress. Titration order consistency is correct for 47{\%} of transcripts for Mix2, 41{\%} for Cufflinks and RSEM and 34{\%} for eXpress. We, further, observe improved repeatability across laboratory sites with a relative increase in R2 between 8{\%} and 44{\%} and reduced standard deviation.},

For particles on the order of 1 µm diameter, these paths are generally inconsistent with simple Brownian motion. Yet, despite an abundance of data confirming these findings and their wide-ranging scientific implications, stochastic modeling of the complex particle motion has received comparatively little attention. Even among posited models, there is virtually no literature on likelihood-based inference, model comparisons, and other quantitative assessments. In this article, we develop a rigorous and computationally efficient Bayesian methodology to address this gap. We analyze two of the most prevalent candidate models for 30 second paths of 1 µm diameter tracer particles in human lung mucus: fractional Brownian motion (fBM) and a Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) consistent with viscoelastic theory. Our model comparisons distinctly favor GLE over fBM, with the former describing the data remarkably well up to the timescales for which we have reliable information.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:The quasi steady-state approximation (QSSA) is frequently used to reduce deterministic models of biochemical networks. The resulting equations provide a simplified description of the network in terms of non-elementary reaction functions (e.g. Hill functions). Such deterministic reductions are frequently a basis for heuristic stochastic models in which non-elementary reaction functions are used to define reaction propensities. Despite their popularity, it remains unclear when such stochastic reductions are valid. It is frequently assumed that the stochastic reduction can be trusted whenever its deterministic counterpart is accurate. However, a number of recent examples show that this is not necessarily the case.RESULTS:Here we explain the origin of these discrepancies, and demonstrate a clear relationship between the accuracy of the deterministic and the stochastic QSSA for examples widely used in biological systems. With an analysis of a two-state promoter model, and numerical simulations for a variety of other models, we find that the stochastic QSSA is accurate whenever its deterministic counterpart provides an accurate approximation over a range of initial conditions which cover the likely fluctuations from the quasi steady-state (QSS). We conjecture that this relationship provides a simple and computationally inexpensive way to test the accuracy of reduced stochastic models using deterministic simulations.CONCLUSIONS:The stochastic QSSA is one of the most popular multi-scale stochastic simulation methods. While the use of QSSA, and the resulting non-elementary functions has been justified in the deterministic case, it is not clear when their stochastic counterparts are accurate. In this study, we show how the accuracy of the stochastic QSSA can be tested using their deterministic counterparts providing a concrete method to test when non-elementary rate functions can be used in stochastic simulations.},

While such bacterial devices have long been engineered to differentiate between combinations of inputs, their potential to process signal timing and duration has been overlooked. In this work, we present a two-input temporal logic gate that can sense and record the order of the inputs, the timing between inputs, and the duration of input pulses. Our temporal logic gate design relies on unidirectional DNA recombination mediated by bacteriophage integrases to detect and encode sequences of input events. For an E. coli strain engineered to contain our temporal logic gate, we compare predictions of Markov model simulations with laboratory measurements of final population distributions for both step and pulse inputs. Although single cells were engineered to have digital outputs, stochastic noise created heterogeneous single-cell responses that translated into analog population responses. Furthermore, when single-cell genetic states were aggregated into population-level distributions, these distributions contained unique information not encoded in individual cells. Thus, final differentiated sub-populations could be used to deduce order, timing, and duration of transient chemical events.},

abstract = {In vertebrates, skin colour patterns emerge from nonlinear dynamical microscopic systems of cell interactions. Here we show that in ocellated lizards a quasi-hexagonal lattice of skin scales, rather than individual chromatophore cells, establishes a green and black labyrinthine pattern of skin colour. We analysed time series of lizard scale colour dynamics over four years of their development and demonstrate that this pattern is produced by a cellular automaton (a grid of elements whose states are iterated according to a set of rules based on the states of neighbouring elements) that dynamically computes the colour states of individual mesoscopic skin scales to produce the corresponding macroscopic colour pattern. Using numerical simulations and mathematical derivation, we identify how a discrete von Neumann cellular automaton emerges from a continuous Turing reaction-diffusion system. Skin thickness variation generated by three-dimensional morphogenesis of skin scales causes the underlying reaction-diffusion dynamics to separate into microscopic and mesoscopic spatial scales, the latter generating a cellular automaton. Our study indicates that cellular automata are not merely abstract computational systems, but can directly correspond to processes generated by biological evolution.},

Many experiments have been conducted to compare DNA methylation profiles under different biological contexts, with the goal of identifying differentially methylated regions (DMRs). Due to the high cost of WGBS experiments, many studies are still conducted without biological replicates. Methods and tools available for analyzing such data are very limited.We develop a statistical method, DSS-single, for detecting DMRs from WGBS data without replicates. We characterize the count data using a rigorous model that accounts for the spatial correlation of methylation levels, sequence depth and biological variation. We demonstrate that using information from neighboring CG sites, biological variation can be estimated accurately even without replicates. DMR detection is then carried out via a Wald test procedure. Simulations demonstrate that DSS-single has greater sensitivity and accuracy than existing methods, and an analysis of H1 versus IMR90 cell lines suggests that it also yields the most biologically meaningful results. DSS-single is implemented in the Bioconductor package DSS.},

abstract = {Single cell gene expression profiling can be used to quantify transcriptional dynamics in temporal processes, such as cell differentiation, using computational methods to label each cell with a 'pseudotime' where true time series experimentation is too difficult to perform. However, owing to the high variability in gene expression between individual cells, there is an inherent uncertainty in the precise temporal ordering of the cells. Pre-existing methods for pseudotime estimation have predominantly given point estimates precluding a rigorous analysis of the implications of uncertainty. We use probabilistic modelling techniques to quantify pseudotime uncertainty and propagate this into downstream differential expression analysis. We demonstrate that reliance on a point estimate of pseudotime can lead to inflated false discovery rates and that probabilistic approaches provide greater robustness and measures of the temporal resolution that can be obtained from pseudotime inference.},

@article{Michel:2017kx,
abstract = {To monitor transcriptional regulation in human cells, rapid changes in enhancer and promoter activity must be captured with high sensitivity and temporal resolution. Here, we show that the recently established protocol TT-seq ("transient transcriptome sequencing") can monitor rapid changes in transcription from enhancers and promoters during the immediate response of T cells to ionomycin and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). TT-seq maps eRNAs and mRNAs every 5 min after T-cell stimulation with high sensitivity and identifies many new primary response genes. TT-seq reveals that the synthesis of 1,601 eRNAs and 650 mRNAs changes significantly within only 15 min after stimulation, when standard RNA-seq does not detect differentially expressed genes. Transcription of enhancers that are primed for activation by nucleosome depletion can occur immediately and simultaneously with transcription of target gene promoters. Our results indicate that enhancer transcription is a good proxy for enhancer regulatory activity in target gene activation, and establish TT-seq as a tool for monitoring the dynamics of enhancer landscapes and transcription programs during cellular responses and differentiation.},

@article{Onken:2016zr,
abstract = {Advances in neuronal recording techniques are leading to ever larger numbers of simultaneously monitored neurons. This poses the important analytical challenge of how to capture compactly all sensory information that neural population codes carry in their spatial dimension (differences in stimulus tuning across neurons at different locations), in their temporal dimension (temporal neural response variations), or in their combination (temporally coordinated neural population firing). Here we investigate the utility of tensor factorizations of population spike trains along space and time. These factorizations decompose a dataset of single-trial population spike trains into spatial firing patterns (combinations of neurons firing together), temporal firing patterns (temporal activation of these groups of neurons) and trial-dependent activation coefficients (strength of recruitment of such neural patterns on each trial). We validated various factorization methods on simulated data and on populations of ganglion cells simultaneously recorded in the salamander retina. We found that single-trial tensor space-by-time decompositions provided low-dimensional data-robust representations of spike trains that capture efficiently both their spatial and temporal information about sensory stimuli. Tensor decompositions with orthogonality constraints were the most efficient in extracting sensory information, whereas non-negative tensor decompositions worked well even on non-independent and overlapping spike patterns, and retrieved informative firing patterns expressed by the same population in response to novel stimuli. Our method showed that populations of retinal ganglion cells carried information in their spike timing on the ten-milliseconds-scale about spatial details of natural images. This information could not be recovered from the spike counts of these cells. First-spike latencies carried the majority of information provided by the whole spike train about fine-scale image features, and supplied almost as much information about coarse natural image features as firing rates. Together, these results highlight the importance of spike timing, and particularly of first-spike latencies, in retinal coding.},
